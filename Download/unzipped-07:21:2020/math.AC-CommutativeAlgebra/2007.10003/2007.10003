We provide an expression for the conductor $c(\Delta)$ of a semimodule $\Delta$ of a numerical semigroup $\Gamma$ with two generators in terms of the syzygy module of $\Delta$ and the generators of the semigroup. In particular, we deduce that the difference between the conductor of the semimodule and the conductor of the semigroup is an element of $\Gamma$, as well as a formula for $c(\Delta)$ in terms of the dual semimodule of $\Delta$.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
A classical problem in the combinatorics of natural numbers is to find a closed expression for the largest natural number that is not representable as a nonnegative linear combination of some relatively prime numbers, called the Frobenius number. This problem can be encoded in terms of getting a formula for the conductor of a numerical semigroup.
%\medskip

A numerical semigroup $\Gamma$ is an additive sub-semigroup of the monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$ such that the greatest common divisor of all its elements is equal to $1$. The complement $\mathbb{N}\setminus \Gamma$ is therefore finite, and its elements are called gaps of $\Gamma$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ is finitely generated and it is not difficult to find a minimal system of generators of $\Gamma$, see. e.g. Rosales and Garc\'ia S\'anchez \cite{RosalesGarciaSanchez}.
%\medskip


The number $c(\Gamma)=\max (\mathbb{N}\setminus \Gamma)+1$ is called the conductor of $\Gamma$; in particular $c(\Gamma)-1$ is the Frobenius number of $\Gamma$. The computation of $c(\Gamma)$ for an arbitrary number of minimal generators of $\Gamma$ is NP-hard (see Ram\'irez Alfons\'in \cite{ram} for a good account of this), but there are some special cases in which a closed formula is available. For example, a closed formula is known for the case of two generators: if $\Gamma=\alpha \mathbb{N}+\beta\mathbb{N}:=\langle \alpha , \beta \rangle$, then $c(\Gamma)=\alpha \beta -\alpha -\beta +1$. However, for a numerical semigroup with more than two generators it is not possible in general to obtain a closed polynomial formula for its conductor in terms of the minimal set of generators (see Curtis \cite{curtis}).
%\medskip

We are interested in subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ which have an additive structure over $\Gamma$ (in analogy with the structure of module over a ring): a $\Gamma$-semimodule is a non-empty subset $\Delta$ of $\mathbb{N}$ with $\Delta+\Gamma\subseteq \Delta$. A system of generators of $\Delta$ is a subset $\mathcal{E}$ of $\Delta$ such that $\Delta=\bigcup_{x\in \mathcal{E}} (x+\Gamma)$; it is called minimal if no proper subset of $\mathcal{E}$ generates $\Delta$. Notice that, since $\Delta\setminus \Gamma$ is finite, every $\Gamma$-semimodule is finitely generated and has a conductor
$$
c(\Delta)=\max (\mathbb{N}\setminus \Delta)+1.
$$

Motivated by the problem of obtaining a closed formula for the conductor of $\Gamma$, it is natural to ask for a closed formula for the conductor of a \(\Gamma\)-semimodule. The purpose of this note is to give a formula for $c(\Delta)$ in the case $\Gamma=\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$ in terms of the generators of the semimodule of syzygies of $\Delta$, see \cite{MU1}, as well as in terms of the generators of the dual of this semimodule, see \cite{MU2}.


\section{Semimodules over a numerical semigroup}

Let $\Gamma$ be a numerical semigroup. This section is devoted to collect the main properties concerning $\Gamma$-semimodules. The reader is referred to \cite{RosalesGarciaSanchez} or \cite{ram} for specific material about numerical semigroups.

Every $\Gamma$-semimodule $\Delta$ has a unique minimal system of generators (see e.g. \cite[Lemma 2.1]{MU1}). Two $\Gamma$-semimodules $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are called isomorphic if there is an integer $n$ such that $x\mapsto x+n$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to $\Delta'$; we write then $\Delta\cong \Delta'$. For every $\Gamma$-semimodule $\Delta$ there is a unique semimodule $\Delta' \cong \Delta$ containing $0$; such a semimodule is called normalized. %The $\Gamma$-semimodule
%$$
%\Delta^{\circ} := \{x-\min \Delta : x \in \Delta\}
%$$
%is called the normalization of $\Delta$; this is the unique $\Gamma$-semimodule isomorphic to $\Delta$ and containing $0$. 
Moreover, the minimal system of generators $\{x_0=0,\ldots , x_n\}$ of a normalized $\Gamma$-semimodule is a $\Gamma$-lean set, i.e. it satisfies that
$$
|x_i-x_j| \notin \Gamma \ \ \mbox{for~any} \ \ 0\leq i <j \leq n,
$$
and conversely, every $\Gamma$-lean set of $\mathbb{N}$ minimally generates a normalized $\Gamma$-semimo\-dule. Hence there is a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of $\Gamma$-semimodules and the set of $\Gamma$-lean sets of $\mathbb{N}$. See  Sect. 2 in \cite{MU1} for the proofs of those statements.


There is another kind of system of generators---not minimal---for a semimodule $\Delta$ of $\Gamma$ relative to $s\in \Gamma\setminus \{0\}$: this is the set of the $s$ smallest elements in $\Delta$ in each of the $s$ classes modulo $s$, namely the set $\Delta \setminus (s+\Delta)$, and is called the Ap\'ery set of $\Delta$ with respect to $s$; we write $\mathrm{Ap}(\Delta,s)$. 
%\medskip

A formula for the conductor in terms of $\mathrm{Ap}(\Delta,s)$ for $s\in \Gamma\setminus \{0\}$ is easily deduced.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:cond_Apery}
Let $\Delta$ be a $\Gamma$-semimodule. For any $s\in \Gamma$ we have that
$$
c(\Delta)=\mathrm{max}_{\leq_\mathbb{N}} \mathrm{Ap}(\Delta,s).
$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The equality follows as in the case $\Delta=\Gamma$, see e.g.~Lemma 3 in Brauer and Shockley \cite{bs}.
\end{proof}



%\medskip


In this paper we will consider numerical semigroups with two generators, say $\Gamma=\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$, with $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\alpha < \beta $ and $\mathrm{gcd}(\alpha, \beta) = 1$.
As mentioned above, the conductor of $\Gamma$ can be expressed as $c=c(\langle \alpha,\beta \rangle)=(\alpha-1)(\beta-1)$. The gaps of $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$ are also easy to describe: they admit a unique representation $\alpha \beta -a\alpha -b \beta$, where $a\in \ ]0,\beta-1]\cap \mathbb{N}$ and $b\in \ ]0,\alpha-1]\cap \mathbb{N}$. This writing yields a map from the set of gaps of $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$ to $\mathbb{N}^2$ given by 
$$\alpha \beta -a\alpha -b \beta \mapsto (a,b),$$ which allows us to identify a gap with a lattice point in the lattice $\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{N}^2$; since the gaps are positive numbers, the point lies inside the triangle with vertices $(0,0),(0,\alpha),(\beta, 0)$. 
%\medskip

In the following we will use the notation
$$
e=\alpha\beta - a(e)\alpha-b(e)\beta
$$
for a gap $e$ of the semigroup $\langle \alpha,\beta \rangle$; if the gap is subscripted as $e_i$ then we write $a_i=a(e_i)$ and $b_i=b(e_1)$. 
%\medskip

Let us denote by \(\leq\) the total ordering in \(\mathbb{N},\) sometimes we will denote it by \(\leq_{\mathbb{N}}\) to remark that it is the natural ordering. In addition, we define the following partial ordering $\preceq$ on the set of gaps:

\begin{definition}\label{jorder}
Given two gaps $e_1,e_2$ of $\langle \alpha , \beta \rangle$, we define 
$$
e_1 \preceq e_2 \ \ :\Longleftrightarrow \ a_1\leq a_2 \ \ \wedge \ \ b_1 \geq b_2
$$
and
$$
e_1 \prec e_2 \ \  :\Longleftrightarrow  \ a_1 < a_2 \ \ \wedge \ \ b_1 >b_2.
$$
\end{definition}

Let $\mathcal{E}=\{0,e_1,\ldots , e_n\} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with gaps $e_i=\alpha\beta -a_i \alpha -b_i\beta$ of $\langle \alpha, \beta , \rangle$ for every $i=1,\ldots, n$ such that $a_1<a_2<\cdots < a_n$. Corollary 3.3 in \cite{MU1} ensures that $\mathcal{E}$ is $\langle \alpha , \beta \rangle$-lean if and only if $b_1>b_2>\cdots > b_n$. 

This simple fact leads to an identification (cf. \cite[Lemma 3.4]{MU1}) between an $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$-lean set and a lattice path with steps downwards and to the right from $(0,\alpha)$ to $(\beta,0)$ not crossing the line joining these two points, where the lattice points identified with the gaps in $\mathcal{E}$ mark the turns from the $x$-direction to the $y$-direction; these turns will be called ES-turns for abbreviation. Figure \ref{fig} shows the lattice path corresponding to the $\langle 5,7 \rangle$-lean set $\{0,9,11,8\}$.

Let $g_0=0,g_1,\ldots , g_n$ be the minimal system of generators of a $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$-semimodule $\Delta$. From now on, we will assume that the indexing in the minimal set of generators of $\Delta$ is such that $g_0=0\preceq g_1\preceq\cdots\preceq g_n$. In \cite{MU1} it was introduced the notion of syzygy of $\Delta$ as the $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$-semimodule
$$
\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta):=\bigcup_{i,j\in \{0,\ldots n\}, i\neq j} \Big ((\Gamma + g_i)\cap (\Gamma + g_j) \Big ).
$$

The semimodule of syzygies of the semimodule $\Delta$ minimally generated by $\{g_0=0,g_1,\dots,g_n\}$ can be characterized as follows (see \cite[Theorem 4.2]{MU1}):
\begin{definition}\label{defin:syz}
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta) =\bigcup_{0\leq k<j\leq n} \Big ((\Gamma + g_k)\cap (\Gamma + g_j) \Big )= \bigcup_{k=0}^{n} (\Gamma + h_k),
\end{equation*}

where $h_1,\ldots , h_{n-1}$ are gaps of $\Gamma$, $h_0,h_n \leq \alpha \beta$, and
\begin{align*}
&h_k \equiv g_k ~\mathrm{ mod }~ \alpha, ~h_ k > g_{k}  \ \mbox{for } k=0,\ldots , n \\
&h_k \equiv g_{k+1} ~ \mathrm{mod } ~\beta,~ h_ k > g_{k+1} \ \mbox{for } k=0,\ldots , n-1\\
&h_n \equiv 0~\mathrm{mod } ~\beta, \ \mathrm{and } ~h_n \geq 0
\end{align*}
\end{definition} 

In particular, \(J=\{h_0,\dots,h_n\}\) is a minimal system of generators of the semimodule \(\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta)\), hence \(h_0\preceq h_1\preceq\cdots\preceq h_n.\) Therefore one can easily seen, that the SE-turns of the lattice path associated to \(\Delta\) can be identified with the minimal set of generators of the syzygy module (we call SE-turns to the turns from the \(y\)--direction to the \(x\)--direction). After that, we can associate to any \(\Gamma\)-semimodule \(\Delta\) a lean set \([I,J]\) where \(I\) is a minimal set of generators of \(\Delta\) and \(J\) a minimal set of generators of \(\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta);\) or equivalently a lattice path. An easy consequence of this fact is the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:aux}
	Let \(\Delta\) be a \(\Gamma\)-semimodule with associated lean set \([I,J],\) with \(I=\{g_0=0,g_1,\dots,g_n\}\) and \(J=\{h_0,\dots,h_n\}\). Then, for any \(h\in J\) we have \(h-\alpha-\beta\notin\Delta.\)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Consider \(h\in J\) such that that \(g_i\prec h\prec g_{i+1}\). Let us denote $(a_j,b_j)$ resp. $(a_{j+1},b_{j+1})$ the coordinates of $g_j$ resp. $g_{j+1}$ in the lattice $\mathcal{L}$; then the element \(h\) is represented in the lattice path as $(a_j,b_{j+1})$, see Definition \ref{defin:syz}. By contradiction, assume that $h-\alpha-\beta\in \Delta$; then there exists a gap \(g\in I\) together with two integers $\nu_1,\nu_2\in\mathbb{N}$ such that 
	\[
	h-\alpha-\beta=\nu_1\alpha+\nu_2\beta+g.
	\]
	Since $h-\alpha-\beta\notin\Gamma$, we may write 
	\[
	h-\alpha-\beta=\alpha\beta-(a_j+1)\alpha-(b_{j+1}+1)\beta.
	\]
	The writing of $g$ as $g=\alpha\beta-a\alpha-b\beta$ is unique whenever $(a,b)\in \mathcal{L}$, therefore
	\[
	a_j+1=a-\nu_1,\quad b_{j+1}+1=b-\nu_2.
	\]
	These equalities yield the conditions $a_j<a,\;\text{and},\;b_{j+1}>b$. As the set $I$ is ordered, this means that $(a,b)=(a_{j+1},b_{j})$, which contradicts the minimality of the set of generators, since $g_j\prec g\prec g_{j+1}$ with $g_{j+1}\neq g\neq g_j$.
\end{proof}

\section{A formula for the conductor of an $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$-semimodule}

In this section we are going to provide a formula for the conductor of a \(\Gamma\)-semimodule with any number of generators in terms of the generators of $\Gamma$ and a special syzygy of the $\Gamma$-semimodule. In particular, we will obtain some relations between the conductor of $\Gamma$ and the conductor of the $\Gamma$-semimodule. Finally, we will provide a formula for the conductor of the \(\Gamma\)-semimodule in terms of its dual.

\begin{theorem}\label{formula}
	Let \(\Delta\) be a \(\Gamma\)-semimodule with associated lean set \([I,J]\) as above, and let \(M:=\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}}\{h\in J\}\) denote the biggest (with respect to the order of the natural numbers) minimal generator of $\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta)$. Then
	\[c(\Delta)=M-\alpha-\beta+1.\]
	In particular, if $(m_1,m_2)$ are the coordinates of the point representing $M$ in the lattice $\mathcal{L}$, we have
	\[c(\Delta)=c(\Gamma)-m_1\alpha-m_2\beta.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let us first prove that \(c(\Delta)-1\) is the Frobenius number of the \(\Gamma\)-semimodule \(\Delta\); it is enough to check (i) that \(c(\Delta)-1\notin\Delta\) and (ii) that if \(\ell\notin\Delta\) with \(\ell\neq c(\Delta)-1\) then \(\ell<c(\Delta)-1.\) 
	The statement (i) is clear by Lemma \ref{lem:aux}, since \(M\in J\). To see (ii), consider \(\ell\notin\Delta\) with \(\ell\neq c(\Delta)-1\); since \(\ell\notin\Delta\), it holds in particular \(\ell\notin\Gamma\). Therefore, we can associate to $\ell$ a point $(a,b)$ in the lattice $\mathcal{L}$. Moreover, \(\ell\) is upon and not contained on the lattice path associated to $I$. This means that there exists some \(j\in J\) with coordinates \((j_1,j_2)\) in the lattice path such that \(a\geq j_1\) and \(b\geq j_2\) with some of the inequalities being strict, otherwise \(\ell\) would be an element of \(\Delta\) since the elements represented by lattice points on and under the lattice path belong to \(\Delta\). Thus, from the representation of \(\ell\) and \(j\) as gaps it is easily checked that \(\ell\leq_{\mathbb{N}}j.\) Hence, since \(M=\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}}\{h\in J\}\) and  \(M\in J\), we have that \(M\geq_{\mathbb{N}}\ell\) for any \(\ell\notin\Delta\), which proves (ii). 
	
	Finally, since $M$ can be represented as a lattice point $(m_1,m_2)\in \mathcal{L}$, we have
	\[c(\Delta)=M-\alpha-\beta+1=\alpha\beta-m_1\alpha-m_2\beta-\alpha-\beta+1=c(\Gamma)-m_1\alpha-m_2\beta.\]
\end{proof}


The value $M$ can be easily characterized in terms of the Ap\'ery set of $\Delta$ with respect to $\alpha+\beta$:

\begin{proposition}
Let \(M:=\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}}\{h\in J\}\) be the biggest minimal generator of the syzygy module with respect to the natural ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ as above, then
$$
M=\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}} \mathrm{Ap}(\Delta,\alpha+\beta).
$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
This is a consequence of Proposition \ref{prop:cond_Apery} for $n=\alpha+\beta \in \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Let \(\Delta\) be a \(\Gamma\) semimodule. Then 
	\[c(\Gamma)-c(\Delta)\in\Gamma.\]
\end{corollary}

We conclude this paper rewriting the formula of Theorem \ref{formula} in terms of the dual \(\Gamma\)--semimodule of \(\Delta\),
\[
\Delta^{\ast}:=\{z\in\mathbb{Z}\;|\;z+\Delta\subset\Gamma\},
\]
see \cite{MU2}. An important fact about the dual semimodule is that the minimal set of generators of \(\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta)\)  is in bijection with the minimal set of generators of \(\Delta^{\ast}\):
\begin{lemma}[\cite{MU2}, Lemma 6.1]\label{lemma:61}
	The minimal sets of generators of \(\Delta^{\ast}\) and \(\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta)\) are in correspondence via the map \(x\mapsto\alpha\beta-x.\)
\end{lemma}
In particular, this bijection together with Theorem \ref{formula} allows to computes the conductor of the semimodule \(\Delta\) in terms of its dual in a natural way:
\begin{corollary}
	Let $\Delta$ be a $\Gamma$-semimodule, and let $\Delta^{\ast}$ be its dual, minimally generated by $x_0,\dots,x_n$. Then
	\[c(\Delta)=\min_{\leq\mathbb{N}}\{x_1,\ldots, x_n\}-\alpha-\beta+1.\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	By Theorem \ref{formula} we have that \(c(\Delta)=\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}}\{h\in J\}-\alpha-\beta+1, \) where \(J\) is a minimal set of generators of \(\mathrm{Syz}(\Delta).\) Lemma \ref{lemma:61} yields the equality $\min_{\leq\mathbb{N}}\{x_i\}=\alpha\beta-\max_{\leq_\mathbb{N}}\{h\in J\}$, which allows us to conclude.
\end{proof}
