\begin{abstract}
One of a key problems in signal reconstruction process with the use of frames is to find a dual frame. 
Typically, a canonical dual frame is used. However, there are many applications where this choice appears to be unfortunate. 
Due to that fact, it is necessary to develop a tool, which helps to find a suitable dual frame. In this paper we give a method to find every dual frames. 
The proposed method is based on Naimark's dilation theorem  and the obtained description of dual frames involves parameters that characterize
extension of a Parseval frame to an orthonormal basis.  These formulas are simplified for frames in finite-dimensional spaces and for near-Riesz bases. 
In the latter case, the simplification is based on the extended and supplemented version
of the Naimark theorem, which is proved in the last part of the paper.

\section{Introduction}
 Frames attract a steady interests in recent  research in applied mathematics because 
  they are used in various areas such as operator theory, signal processing, computer science, engineering, quantum information theory, see, e.g.,  
  \cite{heil, KK, MHC, S} and references therein. They are unavoidable due to the flexibility of  reconstruction. 
  This flexibility is  achievable by many different reconstructions formulas for recovering a signal, which is not the case for bases. 
  One of possible  decompositions might be obtained with the use of canonical dual frame. 
  However, it is not always convenient to use canonical dual frame. Namely, in some of the cases, in order to minimize the reconstruction error, 
  an alternative dual frame might have  better properties  for an application \cite{BLPY, BDE, CK, LO}.
  For this reason, it becomes important to obtain a variety of formulas describing all dual frames for a given frame $\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$
  in a Hilbert space $\K$. We recall that a frame $\F_\psi=\{\psi_j,  j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ satisfying the condition
$f=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(f, \psi_j)\varphi_j$
is called a \emph{dual frame} of $\F_\varphi$.  An example of dual frame of $\F_\varphi$ is  its \emph{canonical dual} 
$\F_\psi=S^{-1}\F_\varphi$, where $S$ is the frame operator of $\F_\varphi$. 
A dual frame which is not canonical is called \emph{an alternate dual frame}.
  
 Alternate dual frames $\F_\psi$  might be obtained with the use of Bessel sequences $\{h_j, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$.
  Namely \cite{chri, SL}, 
  $$
  \psi_j=S^{-1}\varphi_j+h_j-\sum_{i\in\mathbb J}(S^{-1}\varphi_j,\varphi_i)h_i,
  $$
  where $S$ is the frame operator of $\F_\varphi$.  The case of canonical dual frame corresponds to the zero sequence $\{h_i\}$.
  Another description of dual frames deals with the analysis operator $\theta_\varphi$ of the original frame $\F_\varphi$. 
  Precisely \cite[Corollaries 5.6.3, 5.6.4]{chri}, 
  $$
  \psi_j=(\theta_\varphi^*\theta_\varphi)^{-1}\theta_\varphi^*\delta_j+X[I-\theta_\varphi(\theta_\varphi^*\theta_\varphi)^{-1}\theta_\varphi^*]\delta_j,
  $$
  where $\{\delta_j\}$ is the canonical basis for  $\ell_2(\mathbb{J})$ and $X : \ell_2(\mathbb{J}) \to \K$ is a bounded
  operator.

In the present paper we develop another approach to the description of dual frames that is based on frame's version of the
Naimark dilation theorem  proved by Han and Larson \cite{hanlar}.

 We use the well known result\footnote{to the best of our knowledge, it was
firstly noticed by Heil in \cite[Corollary 6.3.5]{Heil1}} that each frame $\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ with frame operator $S$
admits the presentation $\F_\varphi=S^{1/2}\F_e$,  where $\F_e=\{e_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}  \}$ is a Parseval frame  (PF). 
For technical reasons, it is convenient to denote $S=e^Q$, where $Q$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator.
The formula $\F_\varphi=e^{Q/2}\F_e$ exhibits frames as perturbations of PF's $\F_e$
by metric operators $e^{Q/2}$.  It is important that  $e^{Q/2}$ and $\F_e$ are determined uniquely by the given frame  $\F_\varphi$ (see Remark \ref{AGHWMS16}).
\emph{Could one specify these parameters for dual frames?}  We affirmatively answered this question in Theorems \ref{NEW1}, \ref{thm5}.
The key idea is:  assume that the initial frame is  a PF $\F_\varphi=\F_e$.
A dual frame has the form $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$, where $e^{Q/2}$ and $\F_{e^o}$ are unspecified yet.  Due to the Naimark
theorem,  the PF's  $\F_e$ and $\F_{e^o}$ in the initial Hilbert space $\K$ are dilated to orthonormal bases $\{\mathbf{e}_j\}$ and
$\{\mathbf{e}_j^o\}$ of the larger Hilbert space $\Hil\supset\K$, which determine an unitary operator 
 $W\mathbf{e}_j=\mathbf{e}_j^o$ in $\Hil$ such that $e^{-Q/2}=PW|_{\K}$ and $\F_{e^o}=PW\{\mathbf{e}_j\}$, where
 $P$ is the orthogonal projection in $\Hil$ onto $\K$. This fact allows one to relate dual frames with unitary dilations of $e^{-Q/2}$.

General formulas for dual frames (Corollary \ref{DDD2b}, Remark \ref{AGH67}) can be simplified in a variety of cases, for instance,  when the original frame:  has finite potential 
and finite excess; is the Casazza-Christensen frame or is a near-Riesz basis.  The corresponding results are presented in Sections \ref{Sec2.3} -- \ref{Sec2.4}.  
In particular, for a Parseval frame that additionally assumed to be a near-Riesz basis, the simplification is based on extended and supplemented version
of the Naimark theorem for near-Riesz bases, see Section \ref{sec6}.  
 
The proposed approach can be useful for selection of dual frames with prescribed properties. 
In this way we slightly generalize the Han's result \cite{DH} about the existence of Parseval duals  
(Corollary \ref{cor1} and Remark \ref{NEWNEW}). 

 Throughout the paper,  $\K$ means  a complex Hilbert space with scalar product $ (\cdot, \cdot)$ 
linear in the first argument. Sometimes, it is useful to specify the inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ associated with $\K$.
In that case the notation $(\K, (\cdot,\cdot))$ will be used.  All operators in $\K$ are supposed to be linear, the identity operator is denoted by $I$.
The index set $\mathbb{J}$ is countable (or finite) and $|\mathbb{J}|$ means its cardinality.
 
\section{Dual frames}
\subsection{Preliminaries}
Here all necessary information about frame theory are presented in a form convenient for our exposition.
More details  can be found in \cite{chri, hanlar, heil}.

A set of vectors $\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ is called a \emph{frame} in $\K$ 
if there are constants $A$ and $B$, $0<A\leq B<\infty$, such that, for all $f\in\K$, 
\begin{equation}\label{K3}
A\|f\|^2\leq\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}|(f, \varphi_j)|^2\leq{B}\|f\|^2.
\end{equation}

The optimal constants in \eqref{K3}  (maximal for $A$ and minimal for $B$) are
called the frame bounds.  The \emph{frame operator} $Sf=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(f, \varphi_j)\varphi_j$ associated with $\F_\varphi$   is uniformly positive  in $\K$. 

A frame $\F_\varphi$ is called \emph{$A$-tight} if $A=B$.  
The formula \eqref{K3} for $1$-tight frames is similar to the Parseval equality for orthonormal bases: 
$\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}{|(f, \varphi_j)|^2}=||f||^2$ and the corresponding  $1$-tight frame $\F_\varphi$ is called  \emph{a  Parseval frame} (PF in the following). 
 PF's can be considered  as a generalization of orthonormal bases $\F_{e}=\{e_j, j\in\mathbb{J}\}$.
For this reason we use the same notation $\F_{e}$ for  PF's.
 
  It is important that each frame can be reduced to a PF: 
 \emph{if   $\F_\varphi$ is a frame with frame operator $S$,  then 
 $\F_e=S^{-1/2}\F_\varphi=\{e_j=S^{- 1/2}\varphi_j\}$ is a PF.}
Denoting $S=e^Q$ 
we reformulate and extend this result as follows:
\begin{prop}\label{WW1}
The set $\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, j\in\mathbb{J} \}$ is a frame if and only if  there exists a bounded self-adjoint operator $Q$ in $\K$ 
and a PF $\F_e=\{e_j,  j\in\mathbb{J}\}$  such that
\begin{equation}\label{MM1}
 \F_{\varphi}=e^{Q/2}\F_e.
 \end{equation}

The PF $\F_e$ is an orthonormal basis in $\K$ if and only if  $\F_{\varphi}$ is a Riesz basis. 
 The frame operator of  $\F_{\varphi}$  coincides with $S=e^Q$ and
the canonical dual frame has the form  $\F_\psi=e^{-Q/2}\F_{e}$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}\label{AGHWMS16}
There is an essential difference between a  familiar description of frames: $\F_\varphi=U\F_e$, where $\F_e$ is an orthonormal basis  and
$U$ is a bounded and surjective operator in $\K$ (see, e.g., \cite[Theorem 5.5.5]{chri})  and the formula \eqref{MM1}, 
where $Q$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator and  $\F_e$ is a PF.  In the last case,  $Q$ and $\F_e$  \underline{are determined uniquely} 
by the frame $\F_{\varphi}$. Indeed, \eqref{MM1} determines a frame with the frame operator $S=e^Q$ because,
$$
Sf=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(f, \varphi_j)\varphi_j=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(f, e^{Q/2}e_j)e^{Q/2}e_j=e^{Q/2}\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(e^{Q/2}f, e_j)e_j=e^{Q/2}e^{Q/2}f=e^{Q}f.
$$
Therefore, $e^{Q/2}$ in \eqref{MM1} is determined uniquely as the square root of $S$.  Then, $\F_e$ is aslo determined uniquely as 
$\F_e=e^{-Q/2}\F_{\varphi}$.  
\end{rem}

It is easy to see that the operator $e^{Q/2}$ in \eqref{MM1} determines the frame bounds and the potential
of $\F_\varphi$, while the excess of $\F_\varphi$ is characterized by the PF $\F_e$.
Namely, in view of \eqref{K3} and \eqref{MM1}, the frame bounds of $\F_\varphi$ are 
$A={1}/{\|e^{-Q/2}\|^2}$ and   $B=\|e^{Q/2}\|^2$.  
The potential of a frame 
$\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ is defined by 
$$
{\bf FP}[\F_\varphi]=\sum_{j,i\in\mathbb{J}}|(\varphi_i, \varphi_j)|^2
$$
and, if $\dim\K<\infty$,
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS2}
{\bf FP}[\F_\varphi]=\sum_{n=1}^{\dim\K}\lambda_n^4,
\end{equation}
 where $\lambda_n$ are eigenvalues of $e^{Q/2}$  \cite{BF, Caz}. 

Following \cite{BCCL}, 
we recall that the \emph{excess} $e[\F_\varphi]$ of $\F_\varphi$  is the greatest integer $n$ such that  $n$ elements  
can be deleted from the frame $\F_\varphi$ and still leave a complete set, or $\infty$ if there is no upper bound to the number of elements that can be removed.

\begin{lemma}\label{WW1b}
The excesses of a frame $\F_\varphi=e^{Q/2}\F_e$  coincides with the excess of $\F_e$.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Each frame  $\F_\varphi$ determines an analysis operator $\theta_\varphi : \K \to \ell_2(\mathbb{J})$:
$$
\theta_\varphi{f}=\{(f, \varphi_j)\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}}, \qquad f\in\K.
$$
The image ${\mathcal R}(\theta_\varphi)$ of $\theta_\varphi$ coincides with the image  ${\mathcal R}(\theta_e)$ of $\theta_e$, 
since $(f, \varphi_j)=(f, e^{Q/2}e_j)=(e^{Q/2}f, e_j)$.  Due to \cite[Lemma 4.1]{BCCL}, 
$e[\F_\varphi]=\dim[\ell_2(\mathbb{J})\ominus{\mathcal R}(\theta_\varphi)]=\dim[\ell_2(\mathbb{J})\ominus{\mathcal R}(\theta_e)]=e[\F_e]$.
\end{proof}

Given an orthonormal basis\footnote{we use the mathbf font for  an orthonormal basis in $\Hil$ in order to avoid confusion with PF $\F_{e}=\{{e}_j\}$ in $\K$} 
$\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{\mathbf{e}_j, \, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$
in a Hilbert space $\Hil$, and an orthogonal 
projection operator 
$P$ in $\Hil$ onto a subspace $\K$, the set $\F_{e}=P\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{e_j=P\mathbf{e}_j, \, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ is a PF for $\K$. 
The inverse statement is the so-called Naimark  dilation theorem  \cite[Proposition 1.1]{hanlar}:
\begin{thm}\label{Naimark}
Let $\F_e=\{e_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ be a PF in a Hilbert space $\K$. Then there exists a Hilbert space $\M$ and a complementary PF
$\F_{\tilde{e}}=\{\tilde{e}_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ in $\M$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{K3b}
\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{\mathbf{e}_j=e_j\oplus\tilde{e}_j, \  j\in \mathbb{J}\}
\end{equation} 
is an orthonormal basis for $\Hil=\K\oplus\M$. 
The extension of a PF $\F_e$ to an orthonormal basis  $\F_{\mathbf{e}}$ described above is unique up to unitary equivalence.
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}\label{rem2}
It follows from \cite[Lemma 4.1]{BCCL}, the proof of  \cite[Proposition 1.1]{hanlar}, and the relation \eqref{AGHWMS2} that
the dimension of spaces $\K$ and $\M$ in Theorem \ref{Naimark} coincide,  respectively, with the potential ${\bf FP}[\F_e]$ and with the excess 
$e[\F_{e}]$ of $\F_{e}$. Moreover, $\dim\Hil=|\mathbb{J}|={\bf FP}[\F_e]+e[\F_{e}]$.
\end{rem}

\subsection{Dual frames for a Parseval frame}

Let $\F_\varphi=\{\varphi_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ be a frame in $\K$.  
According to Proposition \ref{WW1},  dual frames of  $\F_\varphi$ can be presented as  $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$ for some
 bounded self-adjoint operators $Q$  and PF's $\F_{{e^o}}=\{{e}_j^o, \, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$.
 \emph{Could we specify conditions imposed on $Q$ in this formula?} We begin with the case where $\F_\varphi$
 is a PF, i.e.,  $\F_\varphi=\F_e$.

\begin{thm}\label{NEW1}
Given a  PF $\F_e$ in $\K$ with the excess $e[\F_e]$. 
 If $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$  is a dual frame of $\F_e$, then the bounded operator $Q$ is 
 nonnegative\footnote{a bounded operator $Q$ is called  nonnegative if $(Qf, f) \geq 0$ for $f\in\K$} and
the relation
\begin{equation}\label{NEW2}
\dim\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})\leq{e[\F_e]}
\end{equation}
holds. Conversely, if a bounded  operator $Q$ is nonnegative in $\K$  and \eqref{NEW2} holds,  
then there exists  a PF $\F_{{e^o}}=\{{e}_j^o, \, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ such that  
$\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$  is a dual frame of $\F_e$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$  be a dual frame of $\F_e$. By Theorem \ref{Naimark}, the PF $\F_{e^o}=\{{e}_j^o, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$  can be extended to
an orthonormal basis  $\F_{\mathbf{e}^o}=\{\mathbf{e}_j^o, j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ in a Hilbert space $\Hil^o$ containing $\K$ as a subspace. By the construction, $\dim\Hil=|\mathbb{J}|=\dim\Hil^o$. 
Hence, the spaces  $\Hil$ and  $\Hil^o$ can be identified and the linear operator $W$ acting on vectors of $\F_{\mathbf{e}}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS29} 
 W\mathbf{e}_j=\mathbf{e}_j^o, \qquad j\in\mathbb{J} 
 \end{equation}
 is unitary in  $\Hil$.  
 
 Denote $T=PW|_{\K}$, where  $P$ is the orthogonal 
projection operator in $\Hil$ onto the subspace $\K$.  Since $\F_\psi$ is dual for $\F_e$,
 $$
 f=\sum(f, e_j)\psi_j=e^{Q/2}\sum(f, e_j)e_j^o=e^{Q/2}P\sum(f, e_j)\mathbf{e}^o_j=e^{Q/2}PW\sum(f, \mathbf{e}_j)\mathbf{e}_j=e^{Q/2}PWf
 $$ 
for all $f\in\K$. Therefore,  $e^{Q/2}T=I$ and $T=e^{-Q/2}$. By the construction, $T$ is a contraction in $\K$. Hence, $Q$ is a nonnegative bounded operator.

With  respect to the decomposition $\Hil=\K\oplus\M$ (Theorem \ref{Naimark}) the operator  $W$ has the form
\begin{equation}\label{DDD1}
W=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q/2} &  W_{12} \\
W_{21}  &  W_{22}
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}  
where  $W_{21} : \K\to\M$ and $W_{12} : \M\to\K$. The operator coefficients $W_{ij}$ satisfy additional restrictions  
since $W$ is unitary. In particular, considering $W$ on elements $f\oplus{0}$, we get $((e^{-Q}+W_{21}^*W_{21})f, f)=(f,f)$.
Therefore, 
$$
I-e^{-Q}=W_{21}^*W_{21} \quad   \mbox{and} \quad  \ker(I-e^{-Q})=\ker{W_{21}}. 
$$
 Using the decomposition
$\K=\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})}\oplus\ker(I-e^{-Q})$,  we arrive at the conclusion that  $W_{21} :\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})} \to\M$
is an injective  mapping. Hence, $\dim\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})}\leq{\dim\M}$ that justifies \eqref{NEW2}  due to Remark \ref{rem2}.  

Conversely, given a bounded nonnegative operator $Q$ satisfying \eqref{NEW2}. The non-negativity of $Q$ implies that $T=e^{-Q/2}$ is 
a self-adjoint contraction in $\K$.  Assume that there exists a unitary operator $W$ in $\Hil$ such that $T=PW|_{\K}$.
Then, the set $\F_{\mathbf{e}^o}=\{\mathbf{e}_j^o=W\mathbf{e}_j\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\Hil$ and  $\F_{e^o}=\{e_j^o=P\mathbf{e}_j^o\}=P\F_{\mathbf{e}^o}$
is a PF in $\K$. Denote $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}=\{\psi_j=e^{Q/2}e_j^o\}$. Since
$$
\sum|(f, \psi_j)|^2=\sum|(e^{Q/2}f, e_j^o)|^2=\|e^{Q/2}f\|^2\leq\|e^{Q/2}\|^2\|f\|^2, \quad f\in\K,
$$
the set $\F_\psi$ is a Bessel sequence. Furthermore, 
$$
\sum(f, e_j)\psi_j=e^{Q/2}P\sum(f, e_j)\mathbf{e}^o_j=e^{Q/2}PW\sum(f, \mathbf{e}_j)\mathbf{e}_j=e^{Q/2}PWf=e^{Q/2}e^{-Q/2}f=f
$$
and, hence, $\F_\psi$ is a dual frame of $\F_e$.  

In order to compete the proof one should 
verify that the condition \eqref{NEW2} guarantees  that $e^{-Q/2}$ can be expanded to an unitary operator $W$ in the Hilbert space
$\Hil=\K\oplus\M$ such that $e^{-Q/2}=PW|_{\K}$.
It is easy to see that the operator
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ww}
W=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q/2} &  (I-e^{-Q})^{1/2} \\
(I-e^{-Q})^{1/2}  &  -e^{-Q/2} 
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}
is unitary in the Hilbert space $\K\oplus\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})}$ and $e^{-Q/2}=PW|_{\K}$.  If  \eqref{NEW2} holds, then
$\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})}$ can be considered as a subspace of $\M$.  Defining $W$ as the identity operator
on $\M\ominus\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})}$ we obtain the required unitary operator in $\Hil$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{DDD2b}
A dual frame $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$  of $\F_e$ consists of vectors
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS101}
\psi_j=e_j+e^{Q/2}W_{12}\tilde{e}_j,  \qquad j\in\mathbb{J}.
\end{equation}
where $W_{12}:\M\to\K$ is a part of an unitary operator \eqref{DDD1} and $\{\tilde{e}_j\}$ 
is the complementary PF of $\F_e$ in $\M$  (see \eqref{K3b}).
\end{cor}
\begin{proof} In view of the proof above and \eqref{K3b}, the vectors $e^o_j$ of the PF $\F_{e^o}$
have the form $e^o_j=PW\mathbf{e}_j=e^{-Q/2}e_j+W_{12}\tilde{e}_j$
that completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{NEW1} explains which conditions should satisfy the operator $Q$ in the formula $\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$
 for dual frames.  Analogously, the second counterpart of this formula --  a PF $\F_{{e^o}}$ cannot be selected arbitrarily.
 \begin{cor}\label{AGHWMS50}
 Let  $\F_{{e^o}}$ be a PF in $\K$. The following are equivalent: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] there exists a nonnegative operator $Q$ such that the formula
$\F_\psi=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$ determines a dual frame for $\F_e$;
\item[(b)] the excess of 
$\F_{{e^o}}$  coincides with the excess of the original PF $\F_e$ and the operator $PW|_{\K}$, where $W$ is defined by
\eqref{AGHWMS29},  is  strongly positive in $\K$.
\end{enumerate}
 \end{cor}
 \begin{proof} $(a)\to(b)$. In view of \cite[Theorem 2.2]{BB}, the excess of a dual frame $\F_\psi$ coincides with the excess of $\F_e$.
 Due to Lemma \ref{WW1b},  $e[\F_\psi]=e[\F_{e^o}]$ that gives $e[\F_{e^o}]=e[\F_e]$.  By the proof of Theorem \ref{NEW1},
 the operator $PW|_{\K}$ coincides with $e^{-Q/2}$ and, hence, it is strongly positive.
 
 $(b)\to(a)$. Since $e[\F_{e^o}]=e[\F_e]$, the auxiliary subspaces $\M$  for PF's $\F_{e^o}$ and $\F_{e}$ in Theorem \ref{Naimark}   have the same
 dimension and, therefore these subspaces can be identified. This means that the unitary operator $W$ in \eqref{AGHWMS29} is well posed.
 Denoting $e^{-Q/2}=PW|_{\K}$ and repeating the proof of Theorem \ref{NEW1} we complete the proof.
\end{proof}
 
 \subsection{Dual frames for a PF with finite potential and excess one}\label{Sec2.3}
 Let  $\F_e$ be a PF in a Hilbert space $\K$ with ${\bf FP}[\F_e]=K\in\mathbb{N}$ and $e[\F_e]=1$.
 This means that $\dim{\K}=K$ and $\dim\Hil=K+1$, where $\Hil=\K\oplus\M$ is a Hilbert space in Theorem \ref{Naimark} and
 $|\mathbb{J}|=K+1$. Without loss of generality, we assume that $\mathbb{J}=\{1, 2\ldots, K+1\}$,  $\K=\mathbb{C}^K$, 
 $\M=\mathbb{C}$ and
 $\Hil=\mathbb{C}^{K}\oplus\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{C}^{K+1}$.  

Our aim is the description of all dual frames of $\F_e$. Due to Theorem \ref{NEW1}, one should consider a
nonnegative operator $Q$. Denote $T=e^{-Q/2}$. By the construction, $T$ is a positive contraction operator in $\mathbb{C}^K$
and the inequality  \eqref{NEW2} takes the form
$$
 \dim\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})=\dim\mathcal{R}(I-T)(I+T)=\dim\mathcal{R}(I-T)\leq{e[\F_e]}=1
 $$
 This means that   the positive 
contraction $T$ has a simple eigenvalue $0<\varepsilon\leq{1}$ and the eigenvalue $1$ of the multiplicity $K-1$.
A rudimentary linear algebra exercise leads to the conclusion that such operators $T$ in $\mathbb{C}^K$
are described by the matrices depending on  the choice of  a normalized eigenvector
$u=(u_1, u_2, \ldots u_K)^t$ of $T$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\varepsilon$: 
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS1}
T=e^{-Q/2}=\left[\begin{matrix} 1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_1|^2  &   (\varepsilon-1){u_1}\overline{u}_2  & \ldots  & (\varepsilon-1){u_1}\overline{u}_K \\
(\varepsilon-1){u_2}\overline{u}_1  &  1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_2|^2 &  \ldots  & (\varepsilon-1){u_2}\overline{u}_K \\
\vdots &  \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots  \\
(\varepsilon-1){u_K}\overline{u}_1  &  (\varepsilon-1){u_K}\overline{u}_2 &  \ldots  &  1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_K|^2
\end{matrix}\right].
\end{equation}

Each dual frame $\F_\psi$ has the form $\F_\psi=T^{-1}\F_{e^o}=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$,  where
a PF  $\F_{e^o}$ in $\mathbb{C}^K$ is determined via a unitary dilation $W$ of $T$ onto $\Hil=\mathbb{C}^{K+1}$ 
(see the proof of Theorem \ref{NEW1}).  It is easy to check that required unitary operators in $\Hil=\mathbb{C}^K\oplus\mathbb{C}$ are 
determined by the matrices:
\begin{equation}\label{HH3b}
W=\left[\begin{matrix}
1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_1|^2  &   (\varepsilon-1){u_1}\overline{u}_2  & \ldots  & (\varepsilon-1){u_1}\overline{u}_K   &  \sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}u_1e^{i\theta} \\
(\varepsilon-1){u_2}\overline{u}_1  &  1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_2|^2 &  \ldots  & (\varepsilon-1){u_2}\overline{u}_K  & \sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}u_2e^{i\theta} \\
\vdots &  \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots \\
(\varepsilon-1){u_k}\overline{u}_1  &  (\varepsilon-1){u}_k\overline{u}_2 &  \ldots  &  1+(\varepsilon-1)|u_K|^2 & \sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}u_Ke^{i\theta}\\
\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}\overline{u}_1e^{i\tilde{\theta}} &  \sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}\overline{u}_2e^{i\tilde{\theta}} & \ldots  & \sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}\overline{u}_Ke^{i\tilde{\theta}}  & -{\varepsilon}e^{i(\theta+\tilde{\theta})}
\end{matrix}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\theta, \tilde{\theta}\in[0, 2\pi)$.  

In view of \eqref{DDD1} and \eqref{HH3b}, the operator $W_{12} : \M=0\oplus\mathbb{C}\to\K=\mathbb{C}^{K}\oplus{0}$ acts as the multiplication by
$\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}{e^{i\theta}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1 \\
\vdots \\
u_k
\end{array}
\right]$. Due to the proof of Corollary \ref{DDD2b}, the PF  $\F_{e^o}$ consists of the vectors
 $$
 e^o_j=Te_j+W_{12}\tilde{e}_j=Te_j+\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}{e^{i\theta}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1 \\
\vdots \\
u_K
\end{array}
\right]\tilde{e}_j, \qquad j=1,\ldots{K+1}
 $$ 
 where $\{\tilde{e}_j\}$ is the complementary PF in $\mathbb{C}$ for $\F_e$  (see \eqref{K3b}).  
 Since $\F_\psi=T^{-1}\F_{e^o}$ and $(u_1, \ldots u_K)^t$ is an eigenvector of $T^{-1}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1/\varepsilon$, 
we describe  dual frames $\F_\psi=\{\psi_1, \ldots \psi_{K+1}\}$ as follows: 
\begin{equation}\label{HH6}  
\psi_j=T^{-1}e_j^o=e_j+T^{-1}W_{12}\tilde{e}_j=e_j+\frac{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}}{\varepsilon}{e^{i\theta}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1 \\
\vdots \\
u_K
\end{array}
\right]\tilde{e}_j.
\end{equation}

Besides the simple eigenvalue $1/\varepsilon$, the operator $T^{-1}=e^{Q/2}$ has eigenvalue $1$ of multiplicity $K-1$. This fact
 and \eqref{AGHWMS2} leads to the conclusion  that the potential of $\F_\psi$ is 
 ${\bf FP}[\F_\psi]=K-1+(1/\varepsilon)^4$. 

Each dual frame has the same excess one. This result can be obtained  as the consequence of general statement \cite[Theorem 2.2]{BB} 
or independently: the excess of a dual frame $\F_{{\psi}}=e^{Q/2}\F_{e^o}$  coincides with the excess of $\F_{e^o}$
by Lemma \ref{WW1}. Using Remark \ref{rem2} for the PF's  $\F_{e^o}$ and $\F_e$, we obtain
 $e[\F_{e^o}]=\dim\Hil - {\bf FP}[\F_{e^o}] = K+1-K=e[\F_{e}]$.
 
The parameter ${e^{i\theta}}$ in \eqref{HH6} is redundant and it can be omitted if we assume that   $u=(u_1, \ldots, u_K)^t$
is an arbitrary normalized vector in $\mathbb{C}^K$.

The parameter  $\varepsilon$ in \eqref{HH6} determines the optimal bounds of $\F_\psi$: $A={1}/{\|e^{-Q/2}\|^2}=1$ and   
$B=\|e^{Q/2}\|^2=\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}$. The canonical dual frame corresponds to the case $\varepsilon=1$.
If $\varepsilon<1$ and the normalized vector $u\in\mathbb{C}^K$  is fixed (i.e., $e^{Q/2}$ is fixed),   we obtain a
collection of dual frames $\F_\psi$  parametrized by the choice of $e^{i\theta}$ (that corresponds to the different choices 
of  PF's  $\F_{e^o}$).
 
\begin{rem}
 The above approach can  be used for the construction of dual frames of a PF  with an arbitrary \emph{finite} potential and
 excess. For example, if   ${\bf FP}[\F_e]=n{\geq}m=e[\F_e]$, then the $n\times{n}$-matrix in \eqref{AGHWMS1} will be determined by 
 $m$ orthonormal eigenvectors $\{u(j)\in\mathbb{C}^n\}_{j=1}^m$ corresponding to eigenvalues $0<\varepsilon_1\leq\varepsilon_2\leq\ldots\leq\varepsilon_m\leq{1}$.
 Similarly, $(n+m)\times{(n+m)}$-unitary matrix \eqref{HH3b}  will contain more parameters.
\end{rem}
 
\begin{example} 
 Dual frames for Mercedes frame.
 \end{example}
 In  the Hilbert space $\Hil=\mathbb{C}^3$, we consider the orthonormal basis
$\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2,  \mathbf{e}_3\}$, where 
$$
\mathbf{e}_1=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
\end{array}
\right], \qquad \mathbf{e}_2=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\end{array}
\right], \qquad \mathbf{e}_3=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{array}
\right].
$$

The orthogonal projection of $\F_{\mathbf{e}}$ onto the subspace $\K=\mathbb{C}^2\oplus{0}$
determines  a PF $\F_e=\{e_j\}$, 
$$
e_1=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
0 
\end{array}
\right], \qquad e_2=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} 
\end{array}
\right], \qquad e_3=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
-\frac{1}{2} \\
 -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} 
\end{array}
\right],
$$
which is called the Mercedes frame \cite[p. 204]{heil}.  

By the construction, the excess of  $\F_e$ is $1$,  the potential ${\bf FP}[\F_e]=2$, and the complimentary PF 
$\F_{\tilde{e}}=\{\tilde{e}_1, \tilde{e}_2, \tilde{e}_3\}$ in \eqref{K3b} consists of the vectors 
$\tilde{e}_j=(I-P)\mathbf{e}_j=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Let $u$  be a normalized eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to an eigenvalue $\varepsilon$.
Choosing  
$$
u=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos\alpha \\
-e^{i\beta}\sin\alpha
\end{array}
\right],  \qquad  \alpha, \beta\in[0, 2\pi)
$$ 
and using \eqref{AGHWMS1}, \eqref{HH3b}, we obtain a positive contraction in $\mathbb{C}^2$
$$
T=\left[\begin{matrix}\varepsilon\cos^{2}\alpha + \sin^{2}\alpha  &  (1-\varepsilon)e^{-i\beta}\sin\alpha\cos\alpha \\
(1-\varepsilon)e^{i\beta}\sin\alpha\cos\alpha  & \varepsilon\sin^{2}\alpha + \cos^{2}\alpha 
\end{matrix}\right],  \qquad \alpha, \beta\in[0, 2\pi).
$$
According to \eqref{HH3b}, its unitary dilation onto $\mathbb{C}^3$ has the form
$$
W=\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon\cos^{2}\alpha + \sin^{2}\alpha  &  (1- \varepsilon)e^{-i\beta}\sin\alpha\cos\alpha & {e^{i\theta}}\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}\cos\alpha  \\
(1- \varepsilon)e^{i\beta}\sin\alpha\cos\alpha & \varepsilon\sin^{2}\alpha + \cos^{2}\alpha & -{e^{i\theta}}\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}e^{i\beta}\sin\alpha \\
{e^{i\tilde{\theta}}}\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}\cos\alpha  & -{e^{i\tilde{\theta}}}\sqrt{1- \varepsilon^2}e^{-i\beta}\sin\alpha &  -\varepsilon{e}^{i(\theta+\tilde{\theta})}
\end{matrix}\right], \quad  \theta, \tilde{\theta}\in[0, 2\pi).
$$
In view of \eqref{HH6}, dual frames $\F_\psi=\{\psi_1, \psi_2, \psi_3  \}$ of  the Mercedes frame $\F_e$ are described by the formula
$$ 
\psi_j=e_j+\frac{e^{i\theta}}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{\frac{1-\varepsilon^2}{3}}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos\alpha \\
-e^{i\beta}\sin\alpha
\end{array}
\right] 
$$
that involves four parameters: $\alpha, \beta, \theta\in[0, 2\pi)$ and $0<\varepsilon\leq{1}$. 

\begin{example} 
 SIC-POVM  represented by the Bloch-Sphere.
 \end{example}
SIC-POVM's (symmetric informationally-complete positive operator value measures) are an important class of generalized measure that are used in quantum measurement
 theory \cite{RBSC}. 
For the Hilbert space $\mathbb C^n$, it is defined by a set of $n^2$  normalized  vectors $\{e_j\}_{j=1}^{n^2} \subset \mathbb C^n$,  with  a fixed inner product, 
$|(e_i,e_j)|^2_{i\not=j}=\frac{1}{n+1}$ . We consider $n=2$ and the qubit $\left[\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
0 
\end{array}
\right] \in \mathbb C^2$, due to the properties of SIC-POVM, one can associate 3 vectors from $\mathbb C^2$ to  obtain  the following SIC-POVM 
$$
e_1=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
0 
\end{array}
\right], \qquad e_2=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} 
\end{array}
\right], \qquad e_3=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}  \\
 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}e^{2i \pi/3}
\end{array}
\right],
\qquad e_4=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}  \\
 \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}e^{-2i \pi/3}
\end{array}
\right].
$$

 In order to  visualize SIC-POVM in $\mathbb C^2$  we use the Bloch-Sphere.  For a quantum state $e_i=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
{e_{i,1}} \\
{e_{i,2}} 
\end{array}
\right]$, a density operator $\rho$ is defined as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sicpovm1}
 \rho= \left[\begin{matrix}|e_{i,1}|^2 & e_{i,1}\overline{e}_{i,2} \\
 e_{i,2}\overline{e}_{i,1} & |e_{i,2}|^2 \end{matrix}\right].
\end{equation}

On the other hand, $\rho$ can be expressed via the Pauli matrices and the identity matrix  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sicpovm2}
\rho=\frac{1}{2}\left( \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]+x  \left[\begin{matrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{matrix}\right]+y  \left[\begin{matrix}0 & - i\\i & 0\end{matrix}\right]+z \left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\0 & -1\end{matrix}\right]\right).
\end{equation}
   Combining (\ref{eq:sicpovm1}) and (\ref{eq:sicpovm2}) and iterating for $j=1,\dots,4$, 
   each solution $x,y,z$ gives rise to a vector $f_j$ from the Bloch-Sphere  corresponding to $e_j$ \cite[Chapter 1.1.1]{MR}:
 
$$ f_1=\left[\begin{matrix}0\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right], \qquad f_2=  \left[\begin{matrix}\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3}\\0\\- \frac{1}{3}\end{matrix}\right], \qquad f_3=   \left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\\\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}\\- \frac{1}{3}\end{matrix}\right], \qquad f_4=  \left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\\- \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}\\- \frac{1}{3}\end{matrix}\right].
 $$
 
 Simple calculation shows that $\F_f=\{f_j\}_{j=1}^4$ is a $\frac{4}{3}$-tight frame with the excess $e[F_f]=1$. 
The complementary PF $\{\tilde{e}_j\}_{j=1}^4$   for the PF $\F_e=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\F_f$ consists of vectors:
$\tilde{e}_1=\ldots\tilde{e}_4=\frac{1}{2}$. Dual frames for $\F_e$ are described by  (\ref{HH6}). 
Multiplying this expression by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ we obtain dual frames
 $\F_\psi=\{\psi_j\}_{j=1}^4$ for $\F_f$: 
$$
\psi_j=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(e_j+\frac{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}}{2\varepsilon}u\right),
$$
where $u=(u_1, u_2, u_3)^t$ is an arbitrary normalized vector\footnote{the impact of the parameter ${e^{i\theta}}$ in \eqref{HH6} is implemented
via the freedom of the choice of $u$} in $\mathbb{C}^3$.

  \subsection{Dual frames for the Casazza-Christensen frame}
In general, a PF with infinite excess need not contain a Riesz basis as a subset.  It is easy to construct a frame which does not contain a Riesz basis
if one allows a subsequence of the frame elements to converge to $0$ in norm. For example,  if
 $\{\mathbf{e}_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ is an ONB in $\K$, then the PF  
 $$
 \F_{e}=\{ \mathbf{e}_1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_2, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_2,  \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\mathbf{e}_3, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\mathbf{e}_3, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\mathbf{e}_3, \ldots \}
 $$
 does not contain a Riesz basis at all. The only candidate would be $\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{j}}\mathbf{e}_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$,  which is a Schauder basis but not a Riesz basis.
 It turns out that there exist PF's which consist of vectors that are norm bounded below, but which do not contain a Shauder basis and, therefore they do not contain
a Riesz basis. The relevant curious example was constructed by Casazza and Christensen \cite{CC98}. 
Aiming to describe dual frames for this PF we begin with the description of duals for  finite counterparts of the Casazza-Christensen frame.

 Let $\{\mathbf{e}_j\}_{j=1}^K$, $K\in\mathbb{N}$ be an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space $\K$.
 The set $\F_{e}=\{e_j, j\in\mathbb{J}\}$, where $\mathbb{J}=\{1, 2,\ldots, K+1\}$ and
\begin{equation}\label{K61}
e_j=\mathbf{e}_j-\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\mathbf{e}_i,  \quad 1\leq{j}\leq{K}, \qquad e_{K+1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\sum_{i=1}^{K}\mathbf{e}_i,
\end{equation}
is a PF in $\K$ \cite[Lemma 2.5]{CC98}.  It is easy to see that ${\bf FP}[\F_e]=K$  and  $e[\F_e]=1$. Hence, the dimension of the auxiliary space
$\M$ in  Theorem \ref{Naimark} is one and, without loss of generality we may assume
that $\M=\mathbb{C}$ and $\Hil=\K\oplus\mathbb{C}$.  

It follows from \eqref{K61} that $\|e_j\|^2=1-\frac{1}{K}$, \  $\|e_{K+1}\|^2=1$, and
$$
(e_j, e_p)=-\frac{1}{K}, \quad j\not=p\in\{1,\ldots, K\}; \qquad (e_j, e_{K+1})=0, \quad j\leq{K}.
$$ 
 For this reason, the complimentary PF 
$\F_{\tilde{e}}=\{\tilde{e}_1, \ldots, \tilde{e}_{K+1}\}$ in \eqref{K3b} consists of the vectors 
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{e}_j=\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}, \quad j=1,\ldots,K,   \qquad \tilde{e}_{K+1}=0.
\end{equation*}

By virtue of \eqref{HH6}, dual frames $\F_\psi=\{\psi_1, \ldots \psi_{K+1}\}$ for $\F_e$ are formed by  the vectors: 
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS14}
\psi_j=e_j+\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{\frac{1-\varepsilon^2}{K}}u, \quad j=1,\ldots,K,  \qquad \psi_{K+1}=e_{K+1},
\end{equation}
where $u$ is an arbitrary normalized vector in $\K$.

Let $\K$ be a separable Hilbert space.  Index an orthonormal basis for $\K$ as $\{\mathbf{e}_j^K\}_{j=1}^K$, where $K$ runs the set of natural numbers and 
set $\K_K=\mbox{span}\{\mathbf{e}_1^K, \mathbf{e}_2^K, \ldots \mathbf{e}_K^K\}$.  The vectors $e_j^K\equiv{e_j}$ defined by \eqref{K61}
form a PF $\F_{e^K}=\{e_j^K, \ j=1, 2\ldots{K+1}\}$ of the Hilbert space $\K_K$.
Since $\K=\sum_{K=1}^\infty\oplus\K_K$, the collection of vectors 
\begin{equation}\label{GGG}
\F_{e}=\{e_1^K, e_2^K,\ldots, e_{K+1}^K\}_{K=1}^{\infty}=\bigcup_{K=1}^\infty\F_{e^K}
\end{equation}
is a PF for $\K$. It was shown  \cite{CC98} that this PF does not contain a Riesz/Schauder basis.  

Denote by $\F_\psi^K=\{\psi_1^K, \ldots \psi_{K+1}^K\}$ a dual frame for $\F_{e^K}$ in $\K_K$. 
By analogy with \eqref{AGHWMS14},
$$
\psi_j^K=e_j^K+\frac{1}{\varepsilon_K}\sqrt{\frac{1-\varepsilon^2_K}{K}}u_K,  \quad \psi_{K+1}^K=e_{K+1}^K, \quad u_K\in\K_K, \ \|u_K\|=1.
$$

It follows from \eqref{GGG} that $\F_{\psi}=\{\psi_1^K, \psi_2^K,\ldots, \psi_{K+1}^K\}_{K=1}^{\infty}=\bigcup_{K=1}^\infty\F_{\psi^K}$
is a dual frame for  $\F_{e}$ in $\K$.
 
\subsection{Dual frames for near-Riesz bases}\label{Sec2.4} 
 A frame with finite excess contains a Riesz basis as a subset \cite{Holub}. 
 Such frames are called ``near-Riesz bases'' and behave in many respects like Riesz bases.
 In view of \cite[Theorem 2.2]{BB}, if a PF $\F_e$ is a near-Riesz basis, then all its dual frames $\F_\psi$ are also
near-Riesz bases.  These frames are described by the formula \eqref{AGHWMS101} 
and, for the case of near-Riesz bases,  it can be improved  by specifying  additionally the complementary PF
$\F_{\tilde{e}}$ in the Naimark theorem \ref{Naimark}.

Let $\F_e=\{e_j,  j\in\mathbb{J}\}$ be a PF with finite excess $e[\F_e]$.
Then  the index set can be decomposed $\mathbb{J}=\mathbb{J}_0\cup\mathbb{J}_1$ in such a way
 that the $\F_e^0=\{e_j, j\in\mathbb{J}_0\}$ is a Riesz basis in $\K$ and $e[\F_e]=|\mathbb{J}_1|$. 

By virtue of Proposition \ref{WW1},  $\F_e^0=e^{{Q_0}/2}\F_b$, where a self-adjoint operator $Q_0$ and
an orthonormal basis $\F_b=\{b_j, j\in\mathbb{J}_0\}$ are uniquely determined in $\K$. The operator 
$e^{{Q_0}/2}$ is a positive contraction in $\K$ because
$$
\|f\|^2=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}|(f, e^{{Q_0}/2}b_j)|^2+\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2=\|e^{{Q_0}/2}f\|^2+\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2.
$$
Therefore, $Q_0$ has to be a non-positive bounded operator in $\K$.

Denote 
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS44}
\M_1=\mbox{span}\{e_j,   j\in\mathbb{J}_1\},  \qquad  \F_e^1=\{e_j, j\in\mathbb{J}_1\}.
\end{equation}
By the construction, $\dim\M_1\leq{e[\F_e]}$ and $\F_e^1$ is a frame in $\M_1$ with the excess 
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS33}
e[\F_e^1]=|\mathbb{J}_1|-\dim\M_1=e[\F_e]-\dim\M_1.
\end{equation}

The following statement is proved in Subsection \ref{sec6}.
\begin{thm}\label{Naimark2}
If  a PF $\F_e$ is  a near-Riesz basis, then there exists a Hilbert space $\M_2$ and a complementary PF
$\F_{\tilde{e}}^2=\{\tilde{e}_j^2, \ j\in \mathbb{J}_1\}$ in $\M_2$ such that $\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{\mathbf{e}_j, \ j\in\mathbb{J}\}$, where
$$
\mathbf{e}_j=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
e_j\oplus(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}e_j\oplus{0}, \quad  j\in \mathbb{J}_0 \vspace{2mm}\\
e_j\oplus-(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2}e_j\oplus{\tilde{e}_j}^2, \quad  j\in\mathbb{J}_1
\end{array}\right.
$$
is an orthonormal basis of $\Hil=\K\oplus\M_1\oplus\M_2$. 
The dimension of $\M_2$ coincides with the excess of the frame $\F_e^1$, see \eqref{AGHWMS33}
\end{thm}

\begin{rem}
It is easy to verify that $\F_{\tilde{e}}^1=\{\tilde{e}_j^1, \ j\in \mathbb{J}\}$, where
$$
\tilde{e}_j^1=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}e_j, \quad  j\in \mathbb{J}_0 \vspace{2mm}\\
-(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2}e_j, \quad  j\in\mathbb{J}_1
\end{array}\right.
$$
is a PF in $\M_1$. For this reason, Theorem \ref{Naimark2} can be reformulated as follows: for a PF
$\F_e$ that is a near-Riesz basis there exist Hilbert spaces $\M_1$ and $\M_2$ and PF's  $\F_{\tilde{e}}^1$,
$\F_{\tilde{e}}^2$ in these spaces such that
$$
\F_{\mathbf{e}}=\{\mathbf{e}_j=e_j\oplus\tilde{e}_j^1\oplus\tilde{e}_j^2, \  j\in \mathbb{J}\}
$$
is an orthonormal basis of $\Hil=\K\oplus\M_1\oplus\M_2$ (here we assume that $\tilde{e}_j^2=0$ for $j\in\mathbb{J}_0$).
\end{rem}

The formula for dual frames $\F_\psi$ (see Corollary  \ref{DDD2b}) takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS101b}
\psi_j=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
(I+e^{Q/2}W_{12}(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{1/2})e_j, \quad  j\in\mathbb{J}_0  \vspace{2mm} \\
(I-e^{Q/2}W_{12}(e^{-{Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2})e_j+e^{Q/2}W_{12}\tilde{e}_j^2, \quad  j\in\mathbb{J}_1
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Choosing $Q=-Q_0$ in \eqref{AGHWMS101b} (we can do that because $Q_0$ is non-positive and  \eqref{NEW2} holds due to Lemma \ref{AGHWMS55})
and assuming that $W$ is defined by \eqref{eq:ww} (in this case $W_{12}|_{\M_1}= (I-e^{-Q})^{1/2}$ and $W_{12}|_{\M_2}=0$)
we obtain the simplest alternate dual frame 
$$
\F_\psi=\{\psi_j=e^{-Q_0}e_j, \ j\in\mathbb{J}_0\}\cup\{\psi_j=0, \  j\in\mathbb{J}_1\},
$$
where the non-zero subset $\{e^{-Q_0}e_j=e^{-Q_0/2}b_j, \ j\in\mathbb{J}_0\}$ is the bi-orthogonal Riesz basis for $\F_e^0=e^{{Q_0}/2}\F_b$.

\subsection{Dual  frames for a general frame $\F_\varphi$}
\begin{thm}\label{thm5}
 Given a frame $\F_\varphi=e^{Q_\varphi/2}\F_{e}$.  Each dual frame 
 of $\F_\varphi$ has the form 
\begin{equation}\label{DDD5}
 {\F}_\psi=R_Q{{\F}}_{e^o}, \qquad R_Q=e^{-Q_\varphi}e^{Q/2}e^{Q_\varphi/2},
 \end{equation}
  where $Q$ is a bounded operator  such that $e^{-Q_\varphi}Q$ is nonnegative in $\K$
   and  $\dim\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})\leq{e[\F_\varphi]}$, while
  a PF ${{\F}}_{e^o}$  is determined by the choice of $Q$.  
  The vectors $\psi_j$ of the dual frame  $\F_\psi$ have the form
  \begin{equation}\label{DDD10}
\psi_j=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e_j+R_QW_{12}\tilde{e}_j,  \qquad j\in\mathbb{J},
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{e}_j$ are vectors of the complementary PF $\F_{\tilde{e}}$ for $\F_e$ in 
\eqref{K3b} and $W_{12}:\M\to\K$ is a part of an unitary operator in $\Hil=\K\oplus\M$ 
$$
W=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e^{-Q/2}e^{Q_\varphi/2} &  W_{12} \\
W_{21}  &  W_{22}
\end{array}\right].
$$
 \end{thm}
\begin{proof} Let us consider a new Hilbert space $\K_\varphi\equiv(\K, (\cdot,\cdot)_{\varphi})$ endowed with 
the scalar product $(\cdot,\cdot)_{\varphi}=(e^{-Q_\varphi}\cdot,\cdot)$
equivalent to the original one $(\cdot,\cdot)$.  Each frame in $\K$ remains  to be a frame in $\K_{\varphi}$ with the same excess
(but with changed frame bounds). In particular, the frame $\F_{\varphi}=e^{Q_\varphi/2}\F_{e}$ turns out to be a PF in $\K_{\varphi}$, because
\begin{equation}\label{NEW31}
 \sum{|(f, \varphi_j)_\varphi|^2}=\sum{|(e^{-Q_\varphi/2}f, e^{-Q_\varphi/2}\varphi_j)|^2}=\sum{|(e^{-Q_\varphi/2}f,  e_j)|^2}=\|e^{-Q_\varphi/2}f\|^2=\|f\|^2_\varphi.
\end{equation}

Theorem \ref{NEW1} for the PF $\F_\varphi$  gives the formula 
 \begin{equation}\label{NEW41}
\hat{\F}_\psi=e^{Q/2}\hat{\F}_{e^o}, \qquad  \hat{\F}_{e^o} \ \mbox{is a PF in} \ \K_{\varphi}
\end{equation}
that describes the set of dual frames $\hat{\F}_\psi=\{\hat{\psi}_j, \,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ of $\F_\varphi$ in $\K_{\varphi}$. Here,
$Q$ runs the set of nonnegative operators  in  $\K_{\varphi}$ satisfying $\dim\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})\leq{e[\F_\varphi]}$.  

Let us rewrite  \eqref{NEW41} in terms of the original Hilbert space $\K$.  
First of all, we mention that a frame  $\hat{\F}_\psi$ is dual for $\F_\varphi$ in $\K_{\varphi}$ if and only if the frame
 $\F_\psi=e^{-Q_\varphi}\hat{\F}_\psi$ is dual for $\F_\varphi$ in $\K$, because
 $f=\sum(f, \hat{\psi}_j)_\varphi\varphi_j=\sum(f, e^{-Q_\varphi}\hat{\psi}_j)\varphi_j.$
Further, $Q$ is nonnegative in $\K_{\varphi}$ if and only if $e^{-Q_\varphi}Q$ is nonnegative in $\K$. 
Finally, by analogy with \eqref{NEW31}, ${{\F}}_{e^o}=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}\hat{\F}_{e^o}$ is a PF in $\K$ 
if and only if $\hat{\F}_{e^o}$ is a PF in $\K_\varphi$.  After such preliminary work, \eqref{NEW41} is transformed
to  \eqref{DDD5}.

In order to establish \eqref{DDD10}  we describe in detail the PF ${\hat{\F}}_{e^o}=\{\hat{e}^o_j\}$ in \eqref{NEW41}
by repeating the proof of Theorem \ref{NEW1} for the PF $\F_\varphi$ in $\K_\varphi$. 
It is easy to check that  $\F_{\varphi}=e^{Q_\varphi/2}\F_{e}$ is extended to an ONB $\{\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j, j\in\mathbb{J}\}$
in a Hilbert space $\Hil_\varphi=\K_\varphi\oplus\M$ as follows:
$$
 \hat{\mathbf{e}}_j=e^{Q_\varphi/2}e_j\oplus\tilde{e}_j, \qquad j\in\mathbb{J},
 $$
 where the PF $\F_{\tilde{e}}=\{\tilde{e}_j\}$ is \emph{the same  complementary PF} that was used in  \eqref{K3b}
 for the extension of  $\F_e$ to an ONB $\{\mathbf{e}_j=e_j\oplus\tilde{e}_j\}$ in $\Hil=\K\oplus\M$. Hence, 
 $\hat{e}^o_j=P\hat{W}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j$, where
 $\hat{W}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q/2} &  \hat{W}_{12} \\
\hat{W}_{21}  &  \hat{W}_{22}
\end{array}\right]$ is an unitary operator in $\Hil_\varphi$.

Consider  a unitary mapping of $\Hil_\varphi$ onto $\Hil$ defined by $\Xi(f\oplus{g})=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}f\oplus{g}$.
Then the operator 
$$
W=\Xi\hat{W}\Xi^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e^{-Q/2}e^{Q_\varphi/2} &  e^{-Q_\varphi/2}\hat{W}_{12} \\
\hat{W}_{21}e^{Q_\varphi/2}  &  \hat{W}_{22}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e^{-Q/2}e^{Q_\varphi/2} &  W_{12} \\
W_{21}  &  W_{22}
\end{array}\right]
$$  
is unitary in $\Hil$. Moreover, since  $\Xi\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j={\mathbf{e}}_j$,
 $$
 PW{\mathbf{e}}_j=P\Xi\hat{W}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}P\hat{W}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}\hat{e}^o_j=e^o_j,
 $$ 
where the vectors $\{e^o_j\}$ form a PF  ${{\F}}_{e^o}=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}\hat{\F}_{e^o}$ in \eqref{DDD5}.
Therefore,
$$
\psi_j=R_Qe_j^o=R_Q[e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e^{-Q/2}e^{Q_\varphi/2}e_j+W_{12}\tilde{e}]=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e_j+R_QW_{12}\tilde{e}_j
$$
that completes the proof.
\end{proof}

 The operator $R_Q$ in \eqref{DDD5} is not necessarily self-adjoint in $\K$. For this reason the formula  ${\F}_\psi=R_Q{{\F}}_{e^o}$ in Theorem \ref{thm5}
 differs from the standard presentation of frames ${\F}_\psi=e^{Q/2}{{\F}}_{e}$  (see Proposition \ref{WW1}), that is used consistently in the paper.
 Using the polar decomposition of $R_Q=|R_Q^*|U$ \cite[Chapter VI, (2.26)]{Kato}, where $|R_Q^*|=\sqrt{R_QR^*_Q}=\sqrt{e^{-Q_\varphi}e^Q}$ and $U$ is a unitary 
operator in $\K$, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{KK23}
{\F}_\psi=R_Q{{\F}}_{e^o}=\sqrt{e^{-Q_\varphi}e^Q}U{{\F}}_{e^o}=\sqrt{e^{-Q_\varphi}e^Q}{{\F}}_{Ue^o}=e^{Q_\psi/2}{{\F}}_{Ue^o},
\end{equation}
where ${{\F}}_{Ue^o}=U{{\F}}_{e^o}$ is a PF  and $e^{Q_\psi/2}:=\sqrt{e^{-Q_\varphi}e^Q}$ is a positive self-adjoint operator in $\K$.

\begin{rem}\label{AGH67}
The formula \eqref{KK23} is simplified if the operator $Q$ in Theorem \ref{thm5} is additionally assumed to be \emph{self-adjoint} in $\K$.
Then $Q$ commutes with  $e^{-Q_\varphi}$ (since $e^{-Q_\varphi}Q$ is nonnegative and, hence it is self-adjoint in $\K$) and 
$Q$ turns out to be nonnegative in $\K$.  
The operator $R_Q$ takes the form $R_Q=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}e^{Q/2}=e^{(Q-Q_\varphi)/2}$ and it is positive. This yields
$U=I$ and the formula \eqref{KK23} is rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
{\F}_\psi=e^{(Q-Q_\varphi)/2}{\F}_{e^o}.
\end{equation*}
The case $Q=0$ corresponds to the canonical 
dual frame $\F_\psi=e^{-Q_\varphi/2}{\F}_{e}$.   
\end{rem}

\begin{cor}\label{cor1}
A frame $\F_\varphi=e^{Q_\varphi/2}\F_{e}$ has an $A$-tight dual frame if and only if
$Q_\varphi+\ln{A}I$ is a nonnegative operator in $\K$ and $\dim\mathcal{R}(I-\frac{1}{A}e^{-Q_\varphi})\leq{e[\F_\varphi]}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
The frame operator coincides with $AI$ for $A$-tight frames. Hence, each $A$-tight frame has the form 
$\F_\psi=\sqrt{A}\F_{e^o}$.  On the other hand, dual frames are defined by \eqref{KK23}. 
Comparing these formulas and taking into account that  $e^{Q_\psi/2}$ and ${{\F}}_{Ue^o}$ are determined uniquely 
by  $\F_\psi$ we arrive at the conclusion that $\sqrt{A}=e^{Q_\psi/2}=\sqrt{e^{-Q_\varphi}e^Q}$ or  $e^Q=Ae^{Q_\varphi}$.
Therefore, $Q=Q_\varphi+(\ln{A})I$. Due to Theorem \ref{thm5}, the operator $Q$ satisfies the conditions:
$$
\dim\mathcal{R}(I-e^{-Q})\leq{e[\F_\varphi]},   \quad \mbox{and} \quad e^{-Q_\varphi}Q \quad \mbox{is nonnegative in} \ \K,
$$
which are equivalent to the conditions of Corollary \ref{cor1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{NEWNEW}
Frames hawing Parseval duals were investigated in detail in \cite{BB, DH} by other methods. 
Corollary \ref{cor1} is equivalent to \cite[Proposition 2.4]{DH} for $A=1$.

\subsection{Appendix: The proof of Naimark dilation theorem for near-Riesz bases}\label{sec6}  
\begin{lemma}\label{AGHWMS55}
The subspace $\M_1$ in \eqref{AGHWMS44} coincides with $\mathcal{R}(I-e^{{Q_0}})$ and the frame operator of $\F_e^1$ is $S=I-e^{{Q_0}}$. 
\end{lemma}
 \begin{proof} Let $f\in\K$ and $f\perp\M_1$. Then  $f=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(f, e_j)e_j$ and, hence,
 $(f, e_j)=(f, \gamma_j)$, $j\in\mathbb{J}_0$, where $\{\gamma_j=e^{-{Q_0}/2}b_j\}$ is the bi-orthogonal Riesz basis for $\F_e^0$.
This gives, 
$$
0=(f, \gamma_j-e_j)=(f, (e^{-{Q_0}/2}-e^{{Q_0}/2})b_j)=((I-e^{{Q_0}})f, \gamma_j)
$$
 and $f\in\ker(I-e^{{Q_0}})$.  Thus $\K\ominus\M_1\subset\ker(I-e^{{Q_0}})$.
 
 Conversely, if $f\in\ker(I-e^{{Q_0}})$, then $(f, e_j)=(f, \gamma_j)$ and
 \begin{equation}\label{AGHWMS88}
 f=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(f,\gamma_j)e_j=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(f, e_j)e_j=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}}(f, e_j)e_j
 \end{equation}
(the last identity because $\F_e$ is a PF). This means that $\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}(f, e_j)e_j=0$.
Using the Parseval frame identity \cite[Theorem 3.2]{BCEK} 
$$
\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2-\|\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}(f, e_j)e_j\|^2=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}|(f, e_j)|^2-\|\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(f, e_j)e_j\|^2
$$
and \eqref{AGHWMS88}, we obtain 
$$
\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}|(f, e_j)|^2-\|f\|^2=-\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2.
$$
Therefore, $\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}|(f, e_j)|^2=0$ and $\K\ominus\M_1=\ker(I-e^{{Q_0}})$.  Finally,
$\M_1=\overline{\mathcal{R}(I-e^{{Q_0}})}=\mathcal{R}(I-e^{{Q_0}})$.

The frame operator of $\F_e^1$ is $S=I-e^{{Q_0}}$ because, for all  $g\in\M_1$,
 $$
 {S}g=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}(g, e_j)e_j=g-\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(g, e_j)e_j=g-\sum_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}(e^{{Q_0}/2}g, b_j)e^{{Q_0}/2}b_j=(I-e^{{Q_0}})g.
 $$
 \end{proof}
 
 In view of Lemma \ref{AGHWMS55} and the fact that $e^{-{Q_0}/2}\geq{I}$,  the operator
 $(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}$ is well-defined in $\K$ and its restriction onto $\M_1$ is invertible.
 This allows one to consider the sets of vectors
 $$
 \{\mathbf{e}_j=e_j\oplus(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}e_j \}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}, \qquad \{p_j=e_j\oplus-(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2}e_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}
 $$ 
 in the Hilbert space $\Hil'\equiv\K\oplus\M_1$. 
 
 The first set is an orthonormal system in $\Hil'$ since
 $$
 (\mathbf{e}_j, \mathbf{e}_k)=(e_j, e_k)+((e^{{-Q_0}}-I)e_j, e_k)=(e^{{-Q_0}}e_j, e_k)=(b_j, b_k)=\sigma_{jk}.
 $$
 
 Denote by $\mathcal{L}_0$ the subspace of  $\Hil'$ generated by $\{\mathbf{e}_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_0}$ and set 
 $\mathcal{L}_1=\Hil'\ominus\mathcal{L}_0$.
\begin{lemma}\label{GRR1}
The subspace $\mathcal{L}_1$ coincides with $\mbox{span}\{p_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}$
and the set $\{p_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}$ is a PF in $\mathcal{L}_1$ with the excess $|\mathbb{J}_1|-\dim\M_1$.
\end{lemma}
 \begin{proof}
Each $f\oplus{r}\in\mathcal{L}_1$  is orthogonal to every $\mathbf{e}_j$:
$$
0=(\mathbf{e}_j, f\oplus{r})=(e_j, f)+((e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}e_j, r)=(e_j, f+(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}r).
$$
Therefore, $f=-(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}r$ and, as a result, 
$$
\mathcal{L}_1=\{g=-(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}r\oplus{r}, \ r\in\M_1\}.
$$ 
This means that $\dim\mathcal{L}_1=\dim\M_1$.
On the other hand, each $p_k$ is orthogonal to $\mathcal{L}_0$ since
$$
(\mathbf{e}_j, p_k)=(e_j, e_k)-((e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}e_j, (e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2}e_k)=0.
$$
Therefore, $\mbox{span}\{p_j\}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{L}_1$ and moreover $\mbox{span}\{p_j\}=\mathcal{L}_1$, because
$\dim\mbox{span}\{p_j\}=\dim\M_1$ in view of \eqref{AGHWMS44}.
 For any $g\in\mathcal{L}_1$, 
$$
|(g, p_j)|=|([(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{1/2}+(e^{{-Q_0}}-I)^{-1/2})]r, e_j)|=|(e^{-Q_0/2}r, (I-e^{Q_0})^{-1/2}e_j)|.
$$
 Due to Lemma \ref{AGHWMS55}, $S^{-1/2}\F_e^1=\{(I-e^{Q_0})^{-1/2}e_j\}_{\mathbb{J}_1}$ is a PF in $\M_1$.
 Therefore,
 $$
 \sum_{\mathbb{J}_1}|(g, p_j)|^2=\sum_{\mathbb{J}_1}|(e^{-Q_0/2}r, S^{-1/2}e_j)|^2=\|e^{-Q_0/2}r\|^2=\|g\|^2
 $$
 and $\{p_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}$ is a PF in $\mathcal{L}_1$.  The excess of $\{p_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{J}_1}$ is $|\mathbb{J}_1|-\dim\M_1$.
 \end{proof}
 
 Now, we are ready to proof Theorem \ref{Naimark2}.
 By virtue of  Lemmas \ref{AGHWMS55}, \ref{GRR1},  the set of vectors
$$
 \{\mathbf{e}_j,  \ j\in\mathbb{J}_0\}\cup\{p_j, \ j\in\mathbb{J}_1\}
$$
is a PF in the Hilbert space $\Hil'=\K\oplus\M_1=\mathcal{L}_0\oplus\mathcal{L}_1$ with the excess $|\mathbb{J}_1|-\dim\M_1$.
Applying Theorem \ref{Naimark} and taking into account Remark \ref{rem2} we complete the proof.
