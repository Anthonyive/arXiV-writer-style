  abstract = {Consider the Aldous Markov chain on the space of rooted binary trees with n labeled leaves in which at each transition a uniform random leaf is deleted and reattached to a uniform random edge. Now, fix 1 ≤ k<n and project the leaf mass onto the subtree spanned by the first k leaves. This yields a binary tree with edge weights that we call a “decorated k-tree with total mass n.” We introduce label swapping dynamics for the Aldous chain so that, when it runs in stationarity, the
    decorated k-trees evolve as Markov chains themselves, and are projectively consistent over k. The construction of projectively consistent chains is a crucial step in the construction of the Aldous diffusion on continuum trees by the present authors, which is the n→∞ continuum analog of the Aldous chain and will be taken up elsewhere.},
