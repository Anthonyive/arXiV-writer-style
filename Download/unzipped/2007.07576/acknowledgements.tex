\section*{Acknowledgements}
The material in this article derives from Santamaria's PhD thesis~\cite{santamaria_towards_2019}, written under the supervision of McCusker, and it is, in part, a detailed version of~\cite{mccusker_compositionality_2018}. As such, Santamaria acknowledges the support of an EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership studentship at the
University of Bath, as well as EPSRC grant EP/R006865/1 and the funding support of the Ministero dellâ€™Universit\`a e della Ricerca Scientifica of Italy under Grant No.~201784YSZ5, PRIN2017.

The authors would like to thank John Power for suggesting the notations to handle the manipulation of tuples, which we believe provided a great improvement to the exposition of our theory with respect to~\cite{mccusker_compositionality_2018,santamaria_towards_2019}. We would also like to thank Alessio Guglielmi for his valuable insights on the simplification of the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:acyclic-implies-reachable} with respect to~\cite{mccusker_compositionality_2018,santamaria_towards_2019}.

Finally, we thank Zoran Petri\'c for his kind understanding of our lack of acknowledgement of his results in the past: we hope that with this paper we have finally given him the credit he deserves for his work.
