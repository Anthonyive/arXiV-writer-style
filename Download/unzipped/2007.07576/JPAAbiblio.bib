    abstract = {A general coherence theorem for monoidal closed structures is obtained by modifying the logical approach to coherence questions, due to Lambek [1969, 1990] by making use of linear logic. Linear logic, introduced by Girard, has many advantages which are of use in studying coherence. Most notably, its resource-sensitive nature makes it ideal for studying monoidal closed structures. The logical approach is also modified by using natural deduction rather than sequent calculus. The natural deduction system in question is proof nets, also introduced by Girard. Proof nets have several important properties which are exploited to prove the coherence theorem. In particular, the cut elimination procedure is confluent and strongly normalizing. The approach to coherence is to define a general structure, the autonomous deductive system, for defining many theories of monoidal closed categories. An autonomous deductive system is a deductive system with several added features, which are suggested by the properties of proof nets. It is then possible to give a straightforward criterion for whether a given theory of monoidal closed categories, specified by an autonomous deductive system, is coherent. Finally, a relationship is established between coherence and the composition problem for dinatural transformations. Thus, the dinatural approach to modelling polymorphic types, due to Bainbridge et al. [1990], can be extended to linear polymorphism.},

    abstract = {The first aim of this paper is to attack a problem posed in [1] about uniform families of maps between realizable functors on PER's.To put this into context, suppose that we are given a category C to serve as our category of types. The authors of [1] observe that the types representable in the second-order lambda; calculus and most extensions thereof can be regarded as being obtained from functors (Cop × C)n → C by diagonalisation of corresponding contra and covariant arguments. Terms in the calculus give rise to dinatural transformations. This suggests a general structure in which parametrised types are interpreted by arbitrary functors (Cop × C)n → C, and their elements by dinatural transformations. Unfortunately as the authors of the original paper point out, this interpretation can not be carried out in general since dinaturals do not necessarily compose.However, suppose we are in the extraordinary position that all families of maps which are of the correct form to be a dinatural transformation between functors (Cop × C)n → C are in fact dinatural, a situation in which we have, so to speak, the dinaturality for free. In this situation dinaturals compose. The result is a structure for a system in which types can be parametrised by types (second-order lambda calculus without the polymorphic types). Suppose, in addition, the category in question is complete, then we can perform the necessary quantification (which is in fact a simple product), and obtain a model for the second-order lambda calculus.},

A tc-net is a subclass of normal Petri nets. For a normal Petri net, a sufficient condition for reachability is obtained.
	Reachability for a conflict free Petri net can be decided by finding a firable firing sequence for finite minimal solutions of the matrix equation. This property is also true for larger classes of Petri nets than conflict-free. These are a non-decreasing circuit Petri net (ndc-net) where number of tokens on any circuit is nondecreasing for any firings of transitions, and a non-increasing circuit Petri net (nic-net) where number of tokens on any circuit is non-increasing for any firings of transitions.

These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

Examples are given with a particular emphasis on the category of finite sets.},

We give a sufficient condition on a cartesian-closed full subcategory of the category of algebraic cpos for the characterisation to hold. The condition is quite mild, and the least-fixed-point operator is so characterised in many of the most commonly used categories of domains. By using retractions, the characterisation extends to the associated cartesian-closed categories of continuous cpos. However, dinaturality does not always characterise the least-fixed-point operator. We show that in cartesian-closed full subcategories of the category of continuous lattices the characterisation fails.},
