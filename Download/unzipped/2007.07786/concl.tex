We develop a non-centralized MPC-based economic dispatch scheme for systems of interconnected microgrids. The approach consists of an event-triggered repartitioning method with the aim of maintaining self-sufficiency of each microgrid and decomposing the centralized economic dispatch problem into coalition-based sub-problems in order to compute a feasible but possibly sub-optimal decisions. The main advantage of the approach is a low communication burden, which is essential for online applications. %Additionally, the effectiveness of the approach is also showcased in a numerical study. 
%As future work, we would like to combine self-sufficiency and sub-optimality as the criteria that trigger the repartitioning process since we notice in the case study that the sub-optimality measure might change rapidly due to the repartitioning of the network. Therefore, it might be better for the network to maintain the current partition when the performance is highly compromised. In this regard, the repartitioning and coalition formation procedures might also need to be adjusted.
