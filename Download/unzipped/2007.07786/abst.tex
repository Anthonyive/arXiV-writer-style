A non-centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme for solving an economic dispatch problem of electrical networks is proposed in this paper. The scheme consists of two parts. The first part is an event-triggered repartitioning method that splits the network into a fixed number of non-overlapping sub-systems {(microgrids)}. The objective of the repartitioning procedure is to obtain self-sufficient microgrids, i.e., those that can meet their local loads using their own generation units. However, since the algorithm does not guarantee that all the resulting microgrids are self-sufficient, the microgrids that are not self-sufficient must then form a coalition with some of their neighboring microgrids. This process becomes the second part of the scheme. By performing the coalition formation, we can decompose the economic dispatch problem of the network into coalition-based sub-problems such that each subproblem is feasible. Furthermore, we also show that the solution obtained by solving the coalition-based sub-problems is a feasible but sub-optimal solution to the centralized problem. Additionally, some numerical simulations are also carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
