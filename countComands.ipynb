      "Let $G$ be a graph on the vertex set $$ and the edge set $E(G)$. Let also $S=\\KK$ be the polynomial ring over a field $\\KK$. Then, the \\emph{binomial edge ideal} associated to $G$, denoted by $J_G$, is the ideal in $S$ generated by all the quadratic binomials of the form $f_{ij}=x_{i}y_{j}-x_{j}y_{i}$, where $\\{i,j\\}\\in E(G)$ and $i<j$. This class of ideals were introduced in \\cite{HHHKR} and \\cite{O}, as a natural generalization of determinantal ideals, as well as the ideals generated by the adjacent $2$-minors of a $2\\times n$-matrix of indeterminates.\n",
      "\\par In the meantime, many researchers have studied the algebraic properties and homological invariants of binomial edge ideals. A main goal is to understand how the invariants and properties of the ideal and the underlying graph are related, see e.g. \\cite{A, BN, BMS, EHH, ERT, EZ, KS2, KumarS, MM, RSK2, SK, SK1, SK2} for some efforts in this direction.\n",
      "\\par One of the most interesting homological invariants associated to binomial edge ideals that has attracted much attention is the \\emph{Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity}, (or regularity for simplicity), namely,\n",
      "\\ \\par In \\cite{SK}, the second and third authors of the present paper,\n",
      "characterized the graphs $G$ for which $\\reg S/J_G=1$. They also gave a characterization of the graphs $G$ with $\\reg S/J_G=2$, in \\cite{SK2}. Another important result about the regularity of this class of binomial ideals appeared in \\cite{MM}, where the authors showed that\n",
      "$$\\mathcal{L}(G)\\leq \\reg S/J_G\\leq n-1,$$\n",
      "where $\\mathcal{L}(G)$ denotes the sum of the lengths of longest induced paths of connected components of $G$. Recently, the upper bound $n-1$ has been slightly improved in \\cite{ERT}. In \\cite{MM} the authors additionally conjectured that $\\reg S/J_G\\leq n-2$, if $G$ is not $P_n$, the path on $n$ vertices.\n",
      "Later, in \\cite{KS2}, this conjecture was proved by the second and the third authors of this paper. On the other hand, in \\cite{SK} it was shown that $\\reg S/J_G\\leq c(G)$, for the so-called \\emph{closed} graphs (also known as \\emph{proper interval} graphs), where $c(G)$ denotes the number of maximal cliques of $G$. Afterwards, in $2013$, the following conjecture regarding the regularity of binomial edge ideals was posed by the second and third authors of this paper, (see \\cite{SK1} and\n",

      "\\par Recall that a \\emph{chordal} graph is a graph with no induced cycle of length greater than $3$. In \\cite{EZ}, Ene and Zarojanu verified Conjecture \\ref{conj} for a class of chordal graphs, called \\emph{block} graphs (i.e. chordal graphs in which any two maximal cliques intersect in at most one vertex). In \\cite{JK} the conjecture was proved for the so-called \\emph{fan} graphs of complete graphs, another subclass of chordal graphs. Afterwards in \\cite{RSK}, and later independently in \\cite{Kumar2}, the authors verified Conjecture \\ref{conj} for all chordal graphs. Very recently, in \\cite{KK} the conjecture was proved for $P_4$-free graphs.\n",
      "\\par In this paper first we supply a general upper bound for the regularity of binomial edge ideals. This bound indeed is based on a new concept that we call it compatible maps. In fact, such maps are defined from the set of all graphs to the set of non-negative integers that admit some specific properties. We also introduce the notion of clique disjoint edge set in graphs. Then, we associate to each graph $G$, a graphical invariant denoted by $\\eta(G)$, which is defined as the maximum size of a clique disjoint edge set in $G$. This enables us to provide a good\n",
      "combinatorial candidate of a compatible map which, in turn, yields a combinatorial upper bound for the regularity of binomial edge ideals. Then, in particular, we settle Conjecture \\ref{conj} in full generality.\n",

Notice that finding such characterization yields a precise formula for the regularity of the desired class of graphs. It is worth mentioning here that a characterization of chordal graphs $G$ with $\\mathcal{L}(G)=c(G)$ was given in \\cite{RSK}. Such graphs are called \\emph{strong interval} graphs, which is clear that they satisfy the equality $\\mathcal{L}(G)=\\eta(G)$ as well.\n",

      "Denote its additive group by $\\Ga=(\\K,+)$.\n",
      "Consider the commutative unipotent group~$\\Ga^n=\\Ga\\times\\ldots\\times\\Ga$ ($n$~times).\n",
      "By an additive action on an irreducible algebraic variety~$X$ of dimension $n$ we mean an effective regular action~$\\Ga^n\\times X\\to X$ with an open orbit.\n",
      "If a complete variety~$X$ admits an additive action, we can consider variety~$X$ as an equivariant completion of affine space~$\\A^n$ with respect to the group of parallel translations on~$\\A^n$.\n",
      "A systematic study of additive actions began with the work of Hassett and Tschinkel~\\cite{HT}.\n",
      "They introduced a correspondence between additive actions on the projective space~$\\P^n$ and local $(n+1)$-dimensional commutative associative algebras with a unit; see also~\\cite{KL} for a more general result.\n",
      "Hassett-Tschinkel correspondence allows to obtain the classification of additive actions on projective space~$\\P^n$ for $n \\leq 5$; these are precisely the cases when the number of additive actions is finite.\n",
      "The study of additive actions was originally motivated by Manin's conjecture about the distribution of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties, see works of Chambert-Loir and Tschinkel~\\cite{CLT1, CLT2}.\n",
      "There are some classification results for additive actions on various classes of varieties,\n",
      "in particular, on flag varieties \\cite{A1, Fe, FH, Dev},\n",
      "singular del Pezzo surfaces \\cite{DL},\n",
      "Hirzebruch surfaces \\cite{HT}, and weighted projective planes \\cite{ABZ}.\n",
      "Some results in this direction are\n",
      "devoted to the uniqueness of additive actions.\n",
      "In \\cite{Sh}, it is proved that an additive action on a smooth nondegenerate projective quadric is unique up to isomorhpism.\n",
      "Uniqueness of an additive action on a flag variety that is not isomorphic to a projective space is proved indepently and by completely different methods in~\\cite{FH} and \\cite{Dev}.\n",
      "The present work concerns the uniqueness of additive actions in the case of toric varieties. This problem was raised in~\\cite{AS}.\n",
      "In~\\cite{De}, it is proved that $\\Ga$-actions on a toric variety~$X$ normalized by the acting torus~$T$ are in bijection with some special elements in the character lattice of the torus~$T$ called Demazure roots of the corresponding fan~$\\Sigma$.\n",
      "Let~$\\mathcal{R}(X)$ be the Cox ring of the variety $X$.\n",
      "Cox~\\cite{Cox} noted that normalized $\\Ga$-actions on a toric variety can be interpreted as certain $\\Ga$-subgroups of automorphisms of the ring~$\\mathcal{R}(X)$.\n",
      "In turn, such subgroups correspond to homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of this ring.\n",
      "In~\\cite{AR}, all toric varieties admitting an additive action are described in terms of their fans.\n",
      "It is proved that if a complete toric variety~$X$ admits an additive action, then it admits an additive action normalized by the acting torus.\n",
      "Moreover, any two normalized additive actions on~$X$ are isomorphic.\n",
      "In~\\cite{S}, all additive actions on a complete toric surface were classified.\n",
      "It turns out that there are no more than two non-isomorphic additive actions on a complete toric surface, see Section~\\ref{example} of this work for more details.\n",
      "The present paper suggests a criterion of the uniqueness of additive action on complete toric varieties.\n",
      "Let~$X$ be a complete toric variety with an acting torus~$T$ that admits an additive action.\n",
      "Let~$M$ be the character lattice of~$T$ and~$N$ be the lattice of one-parameter subgroups of~$T$.\n",
      "According to~\\cite{AR}, the rays of the corresponding fan can be ordered in such a way that the primitive vectors on the first $n$ rays form a basis~$p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ of the lattice~$N$ and the remaining rays~$p_{n+1}, \\ldots, p_m$ lie in the negative octant with respect to this basis.\n",
      "Let us denote the dual basis of the basis~${p_1, \\ldots, p_n}$ by~${p_1^*,\\,\\ldots, p_n^*}$.\n",
      "We also consider the set\n",
      "\\ The elements of the set $\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^m\\mathfrak{R}_i$ are called Demazure roots of the variety~$X$.\n",
      "The main result of this paper is described in the following theorem.\n",

      "Let $X$ be a complete toric variety admitting an additive action. The following conditions are equivalent:\n",

      "\\end{enumerate}\n",
      "\\end{thm*}\n",
      "Specifically, assertion~(2) of the theorem is equivalent to the fact that the dimension of a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ of the automorphism group~$\\Aut(X)$ is equal to~$n$, and the group~$U$ is the only candidate for a $\\Ga^n$-group up to conjugation.\n",
      "In opposite case, we construct two additive actions and prove that these actions are non-isomorphic.\n",
      "For example, let us consider the case of projective plane~$\\P^2$.\n",
      "The plane~$\\P^2$ can be considered as toric variety.\n",
      "Let us denote the corresponding fan by $\\Sigma$.\n",
      "As before, we denote the primitive vectors on the rays of the fan~$\\Sigma$ by $p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n",
      "The vector $p_3$ is equal to $-p_1-p_2$.\n",
      "One can compute directly that \\ The automorphism group~$\\Aut(\\P^2)$ is ${\\rm PGL}_3$ and the dimension of a maximal unipotent subgroup is equal to~$3$.\n",
      "The variety~$\\P^2$ does not satisfy assertion~(2) and by the Theorem we get that $\\P^2$ admits at least two non-isomorphic additive actions.\n",
      "In fact, the variety~$\\P^2$ admits precisely two non-isomorphic additive actions, see \\cite{HT}.\n",
      "After presenting some preliminaries on toric varieties and Cox ring (Section~\\ref{coxring}) and $\\Ga$-actions and Demazure roots (Section~\\ref{intrga}), we describe the results of~\\cite{AR} (Section~\\ref{intrbas}).\n",

      "\\section{Introduction}\n",
      "Let $\\K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.\n",
      "Denote its additive group by $\\Ga=(\\K,+)$.\n",
      "Consider the commutative unipotent group~$\\Ga^n=\\Ga\\times\\ldots\\times\\Ga$ ($n$~times).\n",
      "By an additive action on an irreducible algebraic variety~$X$ of dimension $n$ we mean an effective regular action~$\\Ga^n\\times X\\to X$ with an open orbit.\n",
      "If a complete variety~$X$ admits an additive action, we can consider variety~$X$ as an equivariant completion of affine space~$\\A^n$ with respect to the group of parallel translations on~$\\A^n$.\n",
      "A systematic study of additive actions began with the work of Hassett and Tschinkel~\\cite{HT}.\n",
      "They introduced a correspondence between additive actions on the projective space~$\\P^n$ and local $(n+1)$-dimensional commutative associative algebras with a unit; see also~\\cite{KL} for a more general result.\n",
      "Hassett-Tschinkel correspondence allows to obtain the classification of additive actions on projective space~$\\P^n$ for $n \\leq 5$; these are precisely the cases when the number of additive actions is finite.\n",
      "The study of additive actions was originally motivated by Manin's conjecture about the distribution of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties, see works of Chambert-Loir and Tschinkel~\\cite{CLT1, CLT2}.\n",
      "There are some classification results for additive actions on various classes of varieties,\n",
      "in particular, on flag varieties \\cite{A1, Fe, FH, Dev},\n",
      "singular del Pezzo surfaces \\cite{DL},\n",
      "Hirzebruch surfaces \\cite{HT}, and weighted projective planes \\cite{ABZ}.\n",
      "Some results in this direction are\n",
      "devoted to the uniqueness of additive actions.\n",
      "In \\cite{Sh}, it is proved that an additive action on a smooth nondegenerate projective quadric is unique up to isomorhpism.\n",
      "Uniqueness of an additive action on a flag variety that is not isomorphic to a projective space is proved indepently and by completely different methods in~\\cite{FH} and \\cite{Dev}.\n",
      "The present work concerns the uniqueness of additive actions in the case of toric varieties. This problem was raised in~\\cite{AS}.\n",
      "In~\\cite{De}, it is proved that $\\Ga$-actions on a toric variety~$X$ normalized by the acting torus~$T$ are in bijection with some special elements in the character lattice of the torus~$T$ called Demazure roots of the corresponding fan~$\\Sigma$.\n",
      "Let~$\\mathcal{R}(X)$ be the Cox ring of the variety $X$.\n",
      "Cox~\\cite{Cox} noted that normalized $\\Ga$-actions on a toric variety can be interpreted as certain $\\Ga$-subgroups of automorphisms of the ring~$\\mathcal{R}(X)$.\n",
      "In turn, such subgroups correspond to homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of this ring.\n",
      "In~\\cite{AR}, all toric varieties admitting an additive action are described in terms of their fans.\n",
      "It is proved that if a complete toric variety~$X$ admits an additive action, then it admits an additive action normalized by the acting torus.\n",
      "Moreover, any two normalized additive actions on~$X$ are isomorphic.\n",
      "In~\\cite{S}, all additive actions on a complete toric surface were classified.\n",
      "It turns out that there are no more than two non-isomorphic additive actions on a complete toric surface, see Section~\\ref{example} of this work for more details.\n",
      "The present paper suggests a criterion of the uniqueness of additive action on complete toric varieties.\n",
      "Let~$X$ be a complete toric variety with an acting torus~$T$ that admits an additive action.\n",
      "Let~$M$ be the character lattice of~$T$ and~$N$ be the lattice of one-parameter subgroups of~$T$.\n",
      "According to~\\cite{AR}, the rays of the corresponding fan can be ordered in such a way that the primitive vectors on the first $n$ rays form a basis~$p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ of the lattice~$N$ and the remaining rays~$p_{n+1}, \\ldots, p_m$ lie in the negative octant with respect to this basis.\n",
      "Let us denote the dual basis of the basis~${p_1, \\ldots, p_n}$ by~${p_1^*,\\,\\ldots, p_n^*}$.\n",

      "\\ The elements of the set $\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^m\\mathfrak{R}_i$ are called Demazure roots of the variety~$X$.\n",

      "There have been various results as to whether the infinitesimal Torelli property holds for $X$. If the geometric genus $p_g(X)$ vanishes then obviously the infinitesimal Torelli property does not hold. If $X$ is an elliptic K3 surface then it holds by the results on K3 surfaces.\n",
      "The case $g(C)=0$, $p_g(X)\\geq 2$ can be studied by techniques developed by Lieberman--Wilsker--Peters \\cite{LPW} and Kii \\cite{Kii}. These papers give a sufficient criterion for\n",
      "infinitesimal Torelli for varieties with divisible canonical bundle.

      "Let $\\pi:X\\to C$ be a minimal elliptic surface without multiple fibers.\n",
      "There have been various results as to whether the infinitesimal Torelli property holds for $X$. If the geometric genus $p_g(X)$ vanishes then obviously the infinitesimal Torelli property does not hold. If $X$ is an elliptic K3 surface then it holds by the results on K3 surfaces.\n",
      "The case $g(C)=0$, $p_g(X)\\geq 2$ can be studied by techniques developed by Lieberman--Wilsker--Peters \\cite{LPW} and Kii \\cite{Kii}. These papers give a sufficient criterion for\n",
      "infinitesimal Torelli for varieties with divisible canonical bundle. In the latter paper Kii proved infinitesimal Torelli for elliptic surfaces in case $g(C)=0$, $p_g(X)\\geq 2$ and the $j$-invariant is nonconstant. In \\cite{Ext} the author used a similar method to show that infinitesimal Torelli holds if again $g(C)=0$, $p_g(X)\\geq 2$ holds, but the $j$-invariant is constant, and $\\pi$ has at least $p_g(X)+3$ singular fibers. It is well known that an elliptic surface with $p_g(X)\\geq 1, g(C)=0$ has at least $p_g(X)+2$ singular fibers. In \\cite{Ext} it is also shown that elliptic surfaces with $p_g(X)\\geq 2, g(C)=0$ and $p_g(X)+2$ singular fibers do not satisfy infinitesimal Torelli.\n",
      "Chakiris \\cite{Cha}, in his proof of the generic Torelli theorem for elliptic surfaces with a section and $g(C)=0$ obtained a generic infinitesimal Torelli result.\n",
      "One easily checks that Kii's criterion cannot be applied in the case where the genus of $C$ is positive.\n",
      "M.-H. Saito claimed in \\cite{Sai} that infinitesimal Torelli holds for elliptic surfaces without multiple fibers such that\n",
      "$p_g(X)\\geq 1$ and either the $j$-invariant is nonconstant or the $j$-invariant is constant, different from $0,1728$ and $\\chi(\\cO_X)\\geq 3$ hold, but no constraints on the base curve.\n",
      "However, Ikeda \\cite{IkedaTor} recently obtained an example of an elliptic surface without multiple fibers, with nonconstant $j$-invariant and $p_g(X)=g(C)=1$, for which infinitesimal Torelli does not hold.\n",
      "The original purpose of this paper was to give a new proof for infinitesimal Torelli for elliptic surfaces, by methods different from Saito's.\n",
      "However, when preparing this paper, we learned that each of the steps in Saito's proof hold\n",
      "under the additional\n",
      "assumption that $\\Omega^2_X$ is base point free.\n",
      "Our basic idea is to use Green's version of Kii's criterion \\cite{GreenKos}. By doing so, we can reproduce Saito's result under the same hypothesis that $\\Omega^2_X$ is base point free. The main difference with Saito's proof is that In the case of nonconstant $j$-invariant, the infinitesimal Torelli result is almost an immediate corollary from the Green-Kii criterion. In the constant $j$-invariant case our method covers many cases left out by Saito. In particular, we obtain results for elliptic surfaces with constant $j$-invariant 0 and 1728, and for elliptic fiber bundles which are not principal.\n",
      "Moreover, our method yields a series of new counterexamples to infinitesimal Torelli.\n",
      "To formulate our statement, we need a further invariant of the elliptic fibration $\\pi:X\\to C$.\n",
      "Let $\\cL$ be the dual of the line bundle $R^1\\pi_*\\cO_X$ on $C$ and let $d=\\deg(\\cL)$. It is well known that $d\\geq 0$ and $d=0$ corresponds to the case of an elliptic fiber bundle. To apply\n",
      "Green's version of\n",
      "Kii's criterion, we need to check that $\\Omega^2_X$ is base point free. It is easy to check that this happens\n",
      "if $d>1$ or $d=1$ and $h^0(\\cL)=0$.\n",
      "Moreover let $\\Delta$ be the reduced effective divisor on $C$ whose support coincides with the support of the discriminant.\n",
      "In this paper we prove two\n",
      "results on classes of elliptic surfaces for which infinitesimal Torelli holds, one in the nonconstant $j$-invariant case and one in\n",
      "the constant $j$-invariant case.\n",
      "\\begin{theorem} Let $\\pi: X\\to C$ be an elliptic surface without multiple fibers and with nonconstant $j$-invariant. If $d\\neq 1$ or $d=1$ and $h^0(\\cL)=0$ hold then $X$ satisfies infinitesimal Torelli.\n",

      "We will comment a bit one the cases excluded.\n",

      "$(d=1)$ or elliptic K3 surfaces $(d=2)$. For each of these cases it is well known whether infinitesimal Torelli does hold (K3) or does not hold (products and rational surfaces). If $h^1(X)$ is odd and $\\cL\\cong \\cO_C$ then it is known that $X$ does not satisfy infinitesimal Torelli \\cite{Sai} and we will come back to this in Section~\\ref{secFiber}. Hence the only cases not covered by the above two theorems are the cases $d=1$ and $h^0(\\cL)>0$, i.e, when $\\Omega^2_X$ is not base point free.\n",
      "The second theorem does not give a conclusive answer whether infinitesimal Torelli holds, but the map $\\mu_\\pi$ is studied extensively in the literature.\n",

      "The paper is devoted to the following problem: find an efficient method to determine if a given rank decomposition of a homogenous polynomial (form), seen as a symmetric\n",
      "tensor, is minimal and unique, so that the tensor is identifiable in the sense of \\cite{sette}. In other words, we are looking for algorithms, with low computational cost, which determine when a form $ T $ can be written in a unique way as a minimal sum of powers of linear forms (up to scaling).\n",
      "The standard method to determine the identifiability of a tensor, introduced by Kruskal in \\cite{tredici}, provides an algorithm that verifies if a given decomposition\n",
      "of a form $T$ is unique and minimal. Kruskal's algorithm can be implemented in a reasonable computational time. The identifiability of a tensor is relevant for\n",
      "applications in signal processing, image reconstruction, artificial intelligence, statistical mixture models, etc.\n",
      "(see e.g. \\cite{quindici}, \\cite{sedici}, \\cite{diciassette}). Indeed the Kruskal's algorithm is used extensively by researchers in technological fields\n",
      "(see e.g. \\cite{diciotto}).\n",
      "The main weakness of the Kruskal's algorithm is that it can provide an answer for the identifiability of $T$ only if the number of summands in the decomposition is \\emph{small}, compared with the range of possible ranks. This means that Kruskal's method applies only in very specific situations.\n",
      "In order to broaden the range of applicability of Kruskal's type methods, in \\cite{sette} Chiantini, Ottaviani and Vannieuwenhoven introduced the \\emph{reshaped Kruskal's method}. The reshaped Kruskal's method\n",
      "applies in a wider range, with respect to the original Kruskal's method, but it requires the computation of some geometric invariants of a decomposition $A$ of $T$ (see Definition \\ref{remark:span} below).\n",
      "The computational cost of finding these invariants of $A$ is still reasonable, as soon as $A$ is sufficiently general. On the other hand,\n",
      "in special cases, mainly when $A$ is in some \\emph{special position}, the computational cost increases oddly.\n",
      "The aim of this note is to investigate new methods to determine the uniqueness and minimality of a decomposition of $T$,\n",
      "which can produce a considerable cut in the computational cost of the procedure, with respect to the reshaped Kruskal's method,\n",
      "even when $A$ is not in general position.\n",
      "Our new method is based on geometric properties of the decomposition $A$ of $T$, viewed as a finite set of points in a projective space.\n",
      "In a range for the length of $A$ which is similar to the range where the reshaped Kruskal's criterion applies,\n",
      "we will show that the analysis of the Hilbert function of $A$ and its \\emph{Cayley-Bacharach properties} (see the definitions below) produces\n",
      "a criterion which determines that either $A$ is unique, or there exists an infinite family of\n",
      "decompositions of $T$, containing $A$. Next, we show that the existence of the infinite family can be excluded by the analysis\n",
      "of the Terracini's tangent space to the secant variety to a Veronese variety (a classical geometric object for the study of secant varieties, see \\cite{diciannove}).\n",
      "To do that, we extend a procedure introduced and discussed in \\cite{sette} and \\cite{otto}.\n",
      "Thus, summing up the two procedures, we get a new criterion to determine the identifiability of $T$, which is described in Section 4 below.\n",
      "The criterion, which is based on arguments of Algebraic Geometry but requires only algorithms of Linear Algebra,\n",
      "produces an effective method to test the uniqueness (and thus also the minimality) of a decomposition, whose computational cost can be considerably lower than the cost of the reshaped Kruskal's method.\n",
      "We analyse in particular the procedure for the case of ternary forms $T$ (i.e. symmetric tensors of type $3\\times \\dots \\times 3$), for which\n",
      "we know a decomposition $A$, corresponding to a set of points in $\\Pj^2$. This is the first case\n",
      "in which the new methods apply and reduces considerably the computational cost of the procedure, see the final Remark \\ref{compucost}.\n",
      "Of course, a similar analysis applies in more generality, with adjustments for any specific case.\n",
      "We observe that the new method essentially suggests that, in many cases, one can substitute the computation of the higher\n",
      "Kruskal's rank with the computation of the dimension of the Terracini's space, which turns out to be much cheaper in terms of computational cost.\n",

      "tensor, is minimal and unique, so that the tensor is identifiable in the sense of \\cite{sette}. In other words, we are looking for algorithms, with low computational cost, which determine when a form $ T $ can be written in a unique way as a minimal sum of powers of linear forms (up to scaling).\n",
      "The standard method to determine the identifiability of a tensor, introduced by Kruskal in \\cite{tredici}, provides an algorithm that verifies if a given decomposition\n",
      "of a form $T$ is unique and minimal. Kruskal's algorithm can be implemented in a reasonable computational time. The identifiability of a tensor is relevant for\n",
      "applications in signal processing, image reconstruction, artificial intelligence, statistical mixture models, etc.\n",
      "(see e.g. \\cite{quindici}, \\cite{sedici}, \\cite{diciassette}). Indeed the Kruskal's algorithm is used extensively by researchers in technological fields\n",
      "(see e.g. \\cite{diciotto}).\n",
      "The main weakness of the Kruskal's algorithm is that it can provide an answer for the identifiability of $T$ only if the number of summands in the decomposition is \\emph{small}, compared with the range of possible ranks. This means that Kruskal's method applies only in very specific situations.\n",
      "In order to broaden the range of applicability of Kruskal's type methods, in \\cite{sette} Chiantini, Ottaviani and Vannieuwenhoven introduced the \\emph{reshaped Kruskal's method}. The reshaped Kruskal's method\n",
      "applies in a wider range, with respect to the original Kruskal's method, but it requires the computation of some geometric invariants of a decomposition $A$ of $T$ (see Definition \\ref{remark:span} below).\n",
      "The computational cost of finding these invariants of $A$ is still reasonable, as soon as $A$ is sufficiently general. On the other hand,\n",
      "in special cases, mainly when $A$ is in some \\emph{special position}, the computational cost increases oddly.\n",
      "The aim of this note is to investigate new methods to determine the uniqueness and minimality of a decomposition of $T$,\n",
      "which can produce a considerable cut in the computational cost of the procedure, with respect to the reshaped Kruskal's method,\n",
      "even when $A$ is not in general position.\n",
      "Our new method is based on geometric properties of the decomposition $A$ of $T$, viewed as a finite set of points in a projective space.\n",
      "In a range for the length of $A$ which is similar to the range where the reshaped Kruskal's criterion applies,\n",
      "we will show that the analysis of the Hilbert function of $A$ and its \\emph{Cayley-Bacharach properties} (see the definitions below) produces\n",
      "a criterion which determines that either $A$ is unique, or there exists an infinite family of\n",
      "decompositions of $T$, containing $A$. Next, we show that the existence of the infinite family can be excluded by the analysis\n",
      "of the Terracini's tangent space to the secant variety to a Veronese variety (a classical geometric object for the study of secant varieties, see \\cite{diciannove}).\n",
      "To do that, we extend a procedure introduced and discussed in \\cite{sette} and \\cite{otto}.\n",
      "Thus, summing up the two procedures, we get a new criterion to determine the identifiability of $T$, which is described in Section 4 below.\n",
      "The criterion, which is based on arguments of Algebraic Geometry but requires only algorithms of Linear Algebra,\n",
      "produces an effective method to test the uniqueness (and thus also the minimality) of a decomposition, whose computational cost can be considerably lower than the cost of the reshaped Kruskal's method.\n",
      "We analyse in particular the procedure for the case of ternary forms $T$ (i.e. symmetric tensors of type $3\\times \\dots \\times 3$), for which\n",
      "we know a decomposition $A$, corresponding to a set of points in $\\Pj^2$. This is the first case\n",
      "in which the new methods apply and reduces considerably the computational cost of the procedure, see the final Remark \\ref{compucost}.\n",
      "Of course, a similar analysis applies in more generality, with adjustments for any specific case.\n",
      "We observe that the new method essentially suggests that, in many cases, one can substitute the computation of the higher\n",
      "Kruskal's rank with the computation of the dimension of the Terracini's space, which turns out to be much cheaper in terms of computational cost.\n",

      "The study of the singularities of the minimal model program\n",
      "is a cornerstone to prove new results about projective varieties.\n",
      "Many of the important conjectures of the minimal model program\n",

      "Henceforth, a better understanding of klt singularities is a central topic on birational geometry.\n",
      "On the other hand, via global-to-local methods, we can deduce theorems about\n",
      "these singularities,\n",
      "by reducing it to the study of Fano type varieties.\n",
      "Recently, the boundedness of Fano varieties and the theory of complements~\\cites{Bir16a,Bir16b}\n",

      "First, we have the existence of bounded log canonical complements\n",
      "on klt singularities~\\cite{Bir16a}.\n",
      "Secondly, we have the boundedness up to degeneration of exceptional klt singularities~\\cites{Mor18b,HLM19} and the ascending chain condition for minimal log discrepancies\n",
      "of exceptional singularities~\\cites{Mor18a,HLS19}.\n",
      "Finally, we have the Jordan property for the regional fundamental group of $n$-dimensional klt singularities~\\cite{BFMS20}.\n",
      "This result relies on work by Prokhorov and Shramov\n",
      "on the Jordan property for Cremona groups~\\cites{PS14,PS16}.\n",
      "The Jordan property asserts that the local fundamental group of $n$-dimensional klt singularities are almost abelian of rank $n$.\n",
      "In many cases, for instance, surface singularities and toric singularities,\n",
      "much of the local geometry of the singularity can be deduced from its\n",
      "local fundamental group.\n",
      "However, in general, not much can be said unless the fundamental group of the klt singularity is large enough.\n",
      "Then, it is natural to ask whether the existence of a large abelian group on the local fundamental group will reflect on the geometry of the singularity.\n",
      "The first step in this direction was given in~\\cite{Mor20}, where this question\n",

      "The study of the singularities of the minimal model program\n",
      "is a cornerstone to prove new results about projective varieties.\n",
      "Many of the important conjectures of the minimal model program\n",
      "can be reduced to conjectures about Kawamata log terminal singularities.\n",
      "Henceforth, a better understanding of klt singularities is a central topic on birational geometry.\n",
      "On the other hand, via global-to-local methods, we can deduce theorems about\n",
      "these singularities,\n",
      "by reducing it to the study of Fano type varieties.\n",
      "Recently, the boundedness of Fano varieties and the theory of complements~\\cites{Bir16a,Bir16b}\n",
      "had lead to new results about klt singularities.\n",
      "First, we have the existence of bounded log canonical complements\n",
      "on klt singularities~\\cite{Bir16a}.\n",
      "Secondly, we have the boundedness up to degeneration of exceptional klt singularities~\\cites{Mor18b,HLM19} and the ascending chain condition for minimal log discrepancies\n",
      "of exceptional singularities~\\cites{Mor18a,HLS19}.\n",
      "Finally, we have the Jordan property for the regional fundamental group of $n$-dimensional klt singularities~\\cite{BFMS20}.\n",
      "This result relies on work by Prokhorov and Shramov\n",
      "on the Jordan property for Cremona groups~\\cites{PS14,PS16}.\n",
      "The Jordan property asserts that the local fundamental group of $n$-dimensional klt singularities are almost abelian of rank $n$.\n",
      "In many cases, for instance, surface singularities and toric singularities,\n",
      "much of the local geometry of the singularity can be deduced from its\n",
      "local fundamental group.\n",
      "However, in general, not much can be said unless the fundamental group of the klt singularity is large enough.\n",
      "Then, it is natural to ask whether the existence of a large abelian group on the local fundamental group will reflect on the geometry of the singularity.\n",
      "The first step in this direction was given in~\\cite{Mor20}, where this question\n",
      "was settled in dimension three, through the study of\n",
      "large finite automorphisms on Fano type surfaces.\n",
      "The author introduces the class of log crepant equivalent\n",

      "However, at this point, we can't control the Picard rank of $X$.\n",

      "In 1975, K. Saito introduced, with deep insight,\n",
      "the concept of logarithmic differential forms and that of logarithmic vector fields and studied Gauss-Manin connection associated with the versal deformations of hypersurface singularities of type $A_2$ and $A_3$ as applications. These results are published in \\cite{S77}. He developed the theory of logarithmic differential forms, logarithmic vector fields and the theory of residues and published in 1980 a landmark paper \\cite{S}. One of the motivations of his study, as he himself wrote in \\cite{S}, came from the study of Gauss-Manin connections (\\cite{B,S73}). Another motivation came from the importance of these concepts he realized.\n",
      "Notably the logarithmic residue, interpreted as a meromorphic differential form on a divisor, is regarded as a natural generalization of the classical Poincar\\'e residue\n",
      "to the singular cases.\n",
      "In 1990, A. G. Aleksandrov(\\cite{A}) studied Saito theory and gave in particular a characterization of the image of the residue map. He showed\n",
      "that the image sheaf of the logarithmic residues coincides with the sheaf of regular meromorphic differential forms introduced by D. Barlet (\\cite{B}) and M. Kersken (\\cite{K83,K84}).\n",
      "We refer the reader to \\cite{AT,Bru,CM1,CM2,GS,P} for more recent results on logarithmic residues.\n",
      "We consider logarithmic differential forms along a hypersurface with an isolated singularity in the context of computational complex analysis. In our previous paper \\cite{TN20}, we study torsion modules and give an effective method for computing them.\n",
      "In the present paper, we first consider a method for computing regular meromorphic differential forms. We show that, based on the result of A. G. Aleksandrov mentioned above, representatives of regular meromorphic differential forms can be computed by using the algorithm presented in \\cite{TN20} on torsion modules. Main ideas of our approach are the use of the concept of logarithmic residue and that of logarithmic vector field. Next, we show a link between logarithmic differential forms and Gauss-Manin connections, which reveals the role of the torsion module in the computation of a saturation of Brieskorn lattice of Gauss-Manin connection (\\cite{B,Sch,Schu}).\n",

      "In 1975, K. Saito introduced, with deep insight,\n",
      "the concept of logarithmic differential forms and that of logarithmic vector fields and studied Gauss-Manin connection associated with the versal deformations of hypersurface singularities of type $A_2$ and $A_3$ as applications. These results are published in \\cite{S77}. He developed the theory of logarithmic differential forms, logarithmic vector fields and the theory of residues and published in 1980 a landmark paper \\cite{S}. One of the motivations of his study, as he himself wrote in \\cite{S}, came from the study of Gauss-Manin connections (\\cite{B,S73}). Another motivation came from the importance of these concepts he realized.\n",
      "Notably the logarithmic residue, interpreted as a meromorphic differential form on a divisor, is regarded as a natural generalization of the classical Poincar\\'e residue\n",
      "to the singular cases.\n",
      "In 1990, A. G. Aleksandrov(\\cite{A}) studied Saito theory and gave in particular a characterization of the image of the residue map. He showed\n",
      "that the image sheaf of the logarithmic residues coincides with the sheaf of regular meromorphic differential forms introduced by D. Barlet (\\cite{B}) and M. Kersken (\\cite{K83,K84}).\n",
      "We refer the reader to \\cite{AT,Bru,CM1,CM2,GS,P} for more recent results on logarithmic residues.\n",
      "We consider logarithmic differential forms along a hypersurface with an isolated singularity in the context of computational complex analysis. In our previous paper \\cite{TN20}, we study torsion modules and give an effective method for computing them.\n",
      "In the present paper, we first consider a method for computing regular meromorphic differential forms. We show that, based on the result of A. G. Aleksandrov mentioned above, representatives of regular meromorphic differential forms can be computed by using the algorithm presented in \\cite{TN20} on torsion modules. Main ideas of our approach are the use of the concept of logarithmic residue and that of logarithmic vector field. Next, we show a link between logarithmic differential forms and Gauss-Manin connections, which reveals the role of the torsion module in the computation of a saturation of Brieskorn lattice of Gauss-Manin connection (\\cite{B,Sch,Schu}).\n",

A point $P$ not in $X$ is called uniform if the monodromy group of the projection of $X$ from $P$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group. We prove that all the points in $\\bP^{n+1}$ are uniform for $X$, generalizing a result of Cukierman on general plane curves.\n",

      "The monodromy group of linear projections of irreducible complex projective varieties has been intensively studied. Fixed an irreducible and reduced projective hypersurface $X \\subset \\bP^{n+1}$, consider its linear projections from a point $P \\in \\bP^{n+1}$. We want to look at those maps from a topological point of view: in particular, we aim to classify the centres of projection through their monodromy group. We recall that we can give also an algebraic description: indeed, the monodromy group is isomorphic to the Galois group for finite dominant morphisms between irreducible complex varieties \\cite{H}.\n",
      "We will say that a point $P$ is \\emph{uniform} for $X$ if the monodromy group of the projection from $P$ is the symmetric group, \\emph{non uniform} otherwise.\n",
      "A direct consequence of the Castelnuovo's uniform position principle, in the formulation of Harris \\cite{JHCurves}, is that a general projection has always symmetric monodromy group. In 2005 Pirola and Schlesinger \\cite{PS} improved this result showing that an irreducible and reduced plane curve admits at most a finite number of non uniform points. Moreover, in \\cite{CMS} it is proved that smooth surfaces in $\\bP^3$ admit at most a finite number of non uniform points. More recently the author, Cuzzucoli and Moschetti \\cite{CCM} studied the case of hypersurfaces of higher dimension proving that, except for special configurations, the non uniform locus is contained in linear subspaces of codimension two. In particular, we proved that smooth hypersurfaces admit at most a finite number of non uniform points \\cite{CCM}.\n",
      "Examples of smooth hypersurfaces admitting at least a non uniform point are known (see for instance \\cite{Miura1} \\cite{MY1} for plane curves or \\cite{Yoshiara} for hypersurfaces).\n",
      "One may ask if every smooth hypersurface admit non uniform points, but the answer is negative.\n",
      "In 1999 Fernando Cukierman (\\cite{Cuk}) proved that for general plane curves, all the outer points are uniform. In this work we generalize this result proving the following\n",
      "\\begin{thm}\n",
      "Let $X \\subset \\bP^{n+1}$ be a general hypersurface of degree $d>1$. Then all the points $P \\in \\bP^{n+1}$ are uniform.\n",
      "\\end{thm}\n",
      "The result was already known for a special class of non uniform points that are the Galois points (\\cite{Yoshiara}). We remark also that the Theorem extends the result of Cukiermann to inner points of general plane curves.\n",
      "The proof combines inner and outer projections and it is based on an induction argument on the degree of the variety: we degenerate the hypersurface $X$ to a limit one given by a general hypersurface $Y$ of degree $d-1$ and a hyperplane.\n",
      "The base case of the induction ($d=3$, Theorem \\ref{d3}) is consequence of a result of Matsumura and Monsky \\cite{MM} saying that a general hypersurface has trivial automorphism group. More in general, the induction step is based on the study of the behaviour of the monodromy group of the projection $\\pi_P$ of $X$ from $P$ under degenerations (Lemma \\ref{induction}).\n",
      "\\begin{lem}\n",
      "Let $P \\in \\bP^{n+1}$ and let $\\pi_0$ be the map $\\pi_P$ restricted to $Y$. Then, the monodromy group $M(\\pi_0)$ is contained in the monodromy group $M(\\pi_P)$.\n",

      "Let $X$ be a general complex projective hypersurface in $\\bP^{n+1}$ of degree $d>1$. A point $P$ not in $X$ is called uniform if the monodromy group of the projection of $X$ from $P$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group. We prove that all the points in $\\bP^{n+1}$ are uniform for $X$, generalizing a result of Cukierman on general plane curves.\n",

      "The monodromy group of linear projections of irreducible complex projective varieties has been intensively studied. Fixed an irreducible and reduced projective hypersurface $X \\subset \\bP^{n+1}$, consider its linear projections from a point $P \\in \\bP^{n+1}$. We want to look at those maps from a topological point of view: in particular, we aim to classify the centres of projection through their monodromy group. We recall that we can give also an algebraic description: indeed, the monodromy group is isomorphic to the Galois group for finite dominant morphisms between irreducible complex varieties \\cite{H}.\n",
      "We will say that a point $P$ is \\emph{uniform} for $X$ if the monodromy group of the projection from $P$ is the symmetric group, \\emph{non uniform} otherwise.\n",
      "A direct consequence of the Castelnuovo's uniform position principle, in the formulation of Harris \\cite{JHCurves}, is that a general projection has always symmetric monodromy group. In 2005 Pirola and Schlesinger \\cite{PS} improved this result showing that an irreducible and reduced plane curve admits at most a finite number of non uniform points. Moreover, in \\cite{CMS} it is proved that smooth surfaces in $\\bP^3$ admit at most a finite number of non uniform points. More recently the author, Cuzzucoli and Moschetti \\cite{CCM} studied the case of hypersurfaces of higher dimension proving that, except for special configurations, the non uniform locus is contained in linear subspaces of codimension two. In particular, we proved that smooth hypersurfaces admit at most a finite number of non uniform points \\cite{CCM}.\n",

      "If $P \\in Y $, then $S_{d-2}= M((\\pi_0)_{|Y})$. By Lemma \\ref{induction} we have that $M(\\pi_P)$ contains a subgroup that is $d-2$ transitive on $d-2$ points of a general fibre. If moreover $M(\\pi_P)$ is primitive, then by Lemma \\ref{lemma2} we have that it is $2$-transitive. If we apply again Lemma \\ref{lemma1} we get that it is $d$-transitive on a general fibre, i.e. $P$ is uniform.\n",
      "We are then left to prove that the action of $M(\\pi_P)$ is primitive. If $d \\geq 5$ the action of $M(\\pi_P)$ is clearly primitive since $d-2$ does not divide $d$ (see Lemma \\ref{block}). If $d=4$, assume by contradiction that the map $\\pi_P$ is decomposable. The only possibility is that it factors via two maps of degree two $X \\stackrel{2:1}{\\to} Y \\stackrel{2:1}{\\to} \\bP^n.$ The first map can be seen as an involution of the general quartic, hence a non trivial automorphism of $X$.

      "these cases, however, the question about the minimality of the expression remains open. We will see in examples (see Section\n",
      "\\ref{exok}) that a local analysis of the Waring expression cannot guarantee its minimality, except when the length $r$\n",
      "is rather small (as, e.g., in the Kruskal's criterion). We will produce a method which, in principle, can solve the minimality problem,\n",

      "The paper deals with homogeneous polynomials (forms) $F$, which will be also seen as symmetric tensors, over the complex field $\\C$.\n",
      "Our analysis starts with a given{\\it Waring }\n",
      "expression of $F$ in terms of powers of linear forms\n",
      "$$ F= \\lambda_1L_1^d+\\dots +\\lambda_rL_r^d$$\n",
      "($d$ is the degree of $F$). Our target is to determine the minimality and the uniqueness of the expression, up to a scalar multiplication of the $L_i$'s.\n",
      "Indeed,\n",
      "in our setting minimality is a consequence of uniqueness. So, when uniqueness holds, $r$ is the (Waring) rank of $F$.\n",
      "The determination of the rank of a given form, as well as the the uniqueness of a Waring expression,\n",
      "is relevant in several aspects of tensor theory related to physics, signal processing, statistics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, etc.\n",
      "For some examples of these relations, taken from the huge literature on the subject, let us mention the papers\n",
      "\\cite{AllmanMatiasRhodes09}, \\cite{AnandkumarGeHsuKakadeTelgarsky14},\\cite{AppellofDavidson81}, \\cite{RaoLiZhang18}.\n",
      "Our analysis, besides its theoretical interest, will produce the following concrete application. There are several situations in which one\n",
      "knows some Waring expression of a specific form $F$. For instance, this happens when $F$ splits in a sum\n",
      "of blocks whose rank is well known, or when one applies to $F$ some heuristic algorithm, e.g. based on local regression. In\n",
      "these cases, however, the question about the minimality of the expression remains open. We will see in examples (see Section\n",
      "\\ref{exok}) that a local analysis of the Waring expression cannot guarantee its minimality, except when the length $r$\n",
      "is rather small (as, e.g., in the Kruskal's criterion). We will produce a method which, in principle, can solve the minimality problem,\n",
      "and then guarantee that\n",
      "$r$ is the rank of $F$, for all Waring expressions of ternary forms. The consequent algorithm that one can construct\n",
      "depends on the degree $d$. In the last section, we produce a concrete example of the algorithm, for ternary forms of degree\n",
      "$9$.\n",
      "We attack the problem with tools of\n",
      "projective algebraic geometry. Thus, we start with the polynomial ring $R=\n",
      "\\C$ and we indicate with $R_d$ the homogeneous piece of degree $d$. Any linear form $L$ determines\n",
      "a point (which, by abuse of notation, we still indicate with $L$) in the projective space $\\Pj^n$\n",
      "over the linear space $R_1$ of forms of degree $1$. In this notation, $F$ corresponds to a point in the projective space over $R_d$.\n",
      "We identify $\\Pj(R_d)$, of (projective) dimension\n",
      "$N=\\binom{n+d} d -1$, with $\\Pj(Sym^d(R_1))$. The map $\\nu_d:\\Pj^n\\to \\Pj^N$ which\n",
      "sends a linear form $L$ to its $d$-th power is universally known as the $d$-th{\\it Veronese} map.\n",
      "A Waring expression $ F= \\lambda_1L_1^d+\\dots +\\lambda_rL_r^d$ of $F$ determines a subset $A=\\{L_1,\\dots,L_r\\}\\subset\\Pj^n$ such\n",
      "that $F$ sits in the span of $\\nu_d(A)$. In our notation, we will say that $A$ is a{\\it decomposition} of length $r$ of $F$. The decomposition $A$\n",
      "is{\\it non-redundant} if $F$ does not lie in the span of $\\nu_d(A')$, for any proper subset $A'\\subset A$. The decomposition $A$ is{\\it minimal} (resp.{\\it unique}) if there are no other\n",
      "subsets $B\\subset \\Pj^n$, of length $r'< r$ (resp. $r'\\leq r$) such that $F$ belongs to the span of $\\nu_d(B)$.\n",
      "So, when $A$ is minimal, its length is the (Waring) rank of $F$.\n",
      "There are methods that, in some setting, can prove that a decomposition $A=\\{L_1,\\dots,L_r\\}$ of $F$ is unique,\n",
      "and also minimal. For instance,\n",
      "one can take several flattenings of the tensors associated to $F,L_1^d,\\dots, L_r^d $ and use them to prove the uniqueness, as in \\cite{DomaLath13a}, \\cite{DomaLath17}.\n",
      "Alternatively, one can study the catalecticant map $\\alpha$ defined by some partial derivatives of $F$, and the intersection of the image\n",
      "of $\\alpha$ with a suitable Veronese variety, as in \\cite{LandOtt13},\n",
      "\\cite{MassaMellaStagliano18}. The most famous method to prove uniqueness goes back to\n",
      "Kruskal, \\cite{Kruskal77}. Kruskal used the{\\it Kruskal's rank} of the matrix whose entries are the coefficients of the $L_i$'s (i.e. the coordinates\n",
      "of the $L_i$'s, as points in $\\Pj^n$) to produce an inequality which, if satisfied, guarantees that the decomposition is unique,\n",
      "and minimal.\n",

      "have a common problem:\n",
      "they will not provide an answer when the degree $d$ and\n",
      "the length $r$ grow.\n",
      "From the point of view of projective geometry, it is clear that the Waring rank is constant in a Zariski open subset of $\\Pj^N$, i.e.\n",
      "it is constant outside a subset defined by algebraic equations: a small subset, in any reasonable metric.\n",
      "Denote with $r_g$ the{\\it generic} value of the rank,\n",
      "which holds in a dense subset of $\\Pj^N$. Then, it is almost\n",
      "straightforward that a decomposition cannot be unique when $r>r_g$ (too many parameters). When $r=r_g$ generic uniqueness can hold,\n",

      "\\section*{Introduction}\n",
      "This note is motivated by the theory of periods. On the one hand, we can define them as the entries of period matrices between singular cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology for algebraic varieties defined over a number field. This point of view was initiated by Grothendieck in \\cite{grothendieck_66}. It is closely linked to the theory of motives, pure and mixed, see Andr\\'e's \\cite{andre2}.\n",
      "On the other hand, a more hands on approach in terms of integrals over semi-algebraic sets was advanced by Kontsevich and Zagier, see \\cite{kontsevich_zagier}. The two definitions actually agree, see \\cite{period-buch}. More recently, the author together with Commelin and Habegger established a similar comparison result also for exponential periods (where factors of the form\n",
      "$e^{-f}$ are allowed in the integrand), see \\cite{expperI, expPerII}. On the one hand, Kontsevich and Zagier also have given an explicit definition in terms of semi-algebraic geometry.\n",
      "On the other hand, Fr\\'esan and Jossen show how they can be understood as periods of exponential motives, see \\cite{fresan-jossen}. There are some subtelties, but roughly these definitions agree and the numbers appear as volumes of definable sets in a certain o-minimal structure.\n",
      "This raises the question: are these just coincidences or is there a more conceptual explanation for the sudden appearance of semi-algebraic or definable geometry in the theory of periods and motives? Maybe we can extend algebraic de Rham cohomology to semi-algebraic spaces? It turns out, this is not possible, at least not on this naive level.\n",
      "In this note we record the obstruction.\n",
      "We introduce a theory of motives for semi-algebraic spaces over a fixed real closed field $k$ embedded into $\\R$. (See Section~\\ref{sec:generalisations} on more general possible settings.) It has the same universal property as Nori's category of motives for algebraic varieties: it is an abelian tensor category, universal for all cohomology theories compatible with singular homology. Hence a putative de Rham cohomology would also factor. We go on to show that the category of semi-algebraic motives is trivial, i.e., equivalent to the category of finite dimensional $\\Q$-vector spaces. Its Tannaka dual is the trivial group. This would make all periods algebraic over $k$---but they are not. The same arguments apply to Hodge theory---where probably noone expected an extension anyway.\n",
      "We still hope that a more careful de Rham theory could exist, but it would need to take into account more than just the structure of semi-algebraic spaces, e.g., analytic structures.\n",

      "\\section*{Introduction}\n",
      "This note is motivated by the theory of periods. On the one hand, we can define them as the entries of period matrices between singular cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology for algebraic varieties defined over a number field. This point of view was initiated by Grothendieck in \\cite{grothendieck_66}. It is closely linked to the theory of motives, pure and mixed, see Andr\\'e's \\cite{andre2}.\n",
      "On the other hand, a more hands on approach in terms of integrals over semi-algebraic sets was advanced by Kontsevich and Zagier, see \\cite{kontsevich_zagier}. The two definitions actually agree, see \\cite{period-buch}. More recently, the author together with Commelin and Habegger established a similar comparison result also for exponential periods (where factors of the form\n",
      "$e^{-f}$ are allowed in the integrand), see \\cite{expperI, expPerII}. On the one hand, Kontsevich and Zagier also have given an explicit definition in terms of semi-algebraic geometry.\n",
      "On the other hand, Fr\\'esan and Jossen show how they can be understood as periods of exponential motives, see \\cite{fresan-jossen}. There are some subtelties, but roughly these definitions agree and the numbers appear as volumes of definable sets in a certain o-minimal structure.\n",
      "This raises the question: are these just coincidences or is there a more conceptual explanation for the sudden appearance of semi-algebraic or definable geometry in the theory of periods and motives? Maybe we can extend algebraic de Rham cohomology to semi-algebraic spaces? It turns out, this is not possible, at least not on this naive level.\n",
      "In this note we record the obstruction.\n",
      "We introduce a theory of motives for semi-algebraic spaces over a fixed real closed field $k$ embedded into $\\R$. (See Section~\\ref{sec:generalisations} on more general possible settings.) It has the same universal property as Nori's category of motives for algebraic varieties: it is an abelian tensor category, universal for all cohomology theories compatible with singular homology. Hence a putative de Rham cohomology would also factor. We go on to show that the category of semi-algebraic motives is trivial, i.e., equivalent to the category of finite dimensional $\\Q$-vector spaces. Its Tannaka dual is the trivial group. This would make all periods algebraic over $k$---but they are not. The same arguments apply to Hodge theory---where probably noone expected an extension anyway.\n",
      "We still hope that a more careful de Rham theory could exist, but it would need to take into account more than just the structure of semi-algebraic spaces, e.g., analytic structures.\n",

In the next paragraphs we recall some results concerning the well-posedness in weighted Sobolev spaces and which are close to the main issue of this manuscript. Here and throughout the paper by well-posedness we mean in Kato's sense, that is, it includes existence, uniqueness, persistence (if the initial data belongs to some function space $X$ then there exists a unique solution that also belong to $X$) and continuous dependence upon the initial data. In addition, if these properties hold in a small time interval we say the IVP is locally well-posed; on the other, if the properties hold for all $t>0$ we say that the IVP is globally well-posed.\n",
      "Concerning the ZK equation, the IVP in weighted spaces was studied in \\cite{BUM} and \\cite{FP}.\n",

      "\\cite{BUM} the authors proved the local well-posedness in the isotropic space $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+x^2+y^2)^{s/2}dxdy)$, $s>3/4$; in their proof they took the advantage of change of variables introduced in \\cite{GHerr} in order to explore the symmetric form of \\eqref{zk}. On the other hand, in \\cite{FP} the authors proved the local well-posedness in the anisotropic spaces $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+|x|^{2r_1}+|y|^{2r_2})dxdy)$, where $s>3/4$ and $r_1,r_2>0$ are such that $\\max\\{r_1,r_2\\}\\leq s/2$. Their proof is a little bit different from the one \\cite{BUM}; the main tool is a commutator estimate between weights and the linear group associated with \\eqref{zk}. In addition, their method also extend to the generalized nonlinearity $u^ku_x$, $k\\geq2$.\n",
      "Concerning the BO-ZK equation, local well posedness in weighted spaces was studied in \\cite{AP} from several viewpoints. First the authors proved local well-posedness in $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2(w^2dxdy)$, $s>2$, provided $w=w(x,y)$ is a weight with bounded derivatives up to order three. In addition, if $r\\in(1,5/2)$ and $s\\geq2r$ then local well-posedness holds in $\\mathcal{Z}_{s,r}:=H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+x^2+y^2)^rdxdy)$. Also, if $r\\in,\n",

By using the short-time Strichartz method introduced in \\cite{KT} to deal with the Benjamin-Ono equation the authors in \\cite{HLRKW} considered $a=0$ and established local well-posedness in $H^s(\\R^2)$, $s>5/3$. They also proved an ill-posedness result in the sense that the data-to-solution map cannot be $C^2$-differentiable from $H^s(\\R^2)$ to $H^s(\\R^2)$, for any $s\\in\\R$. The local well-posedness was extended to $0\\leq a<1$ in \\cite{Schippa} where, by using transversality and localization of time to small frequency dependent time intervals, the author showed the local well-posedness in $H^s(\\R^2)$, $s>3/2-a$. In weighted spaces, local well-posedness was studied in \\cite{riano} only for $a=0$. In particular it was shown that local well-posedness in $\\mathcal{Z}_{s,r}$ holds for $s\\geq r$ and $r\\in$ and $s>\\frac{2}{a+1}-\\frac{3}{4}$.

In the next paragraphs we recall some results concerning the well-posedness in weighted Sobolev spaces and which are close to the main issue of this manuscript. Here and throughout the paper by well-posedness we mean in Kato's sense, that is, it includes existence, uniqueness, persistence (if the initial data belongs to some function space $X$ then there exists a unique solution that also belong to $X$) and continuous dependence upon the initial data. In addition, if these properties hold in a small time interval we say the IVP is locally well-posed; on the other, if the properties hold for all $t>0$ we say that the IVP is globally well-posed.\n",
      "Concerning the ZK equation, the IVP in weighted spaces was studied in \\cite{BUM} and \\cite{FP}.\n",

      "\\cite{BUM} the authors proved the local well-posedness in the isotropic space $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+x^2+y^2)^{s/2}dxdy)$, $s>3/4$; in their proof they took the advantage of change of variables introduced in \\cite{GHerr} in order to explore the symmetric form of \\eqref{zk}. On the other hand, in \\cite{FP} the authors proved the local well-posedness in the anisotropic spaces $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+|x|^{2r_1}+|y|^{2r_2})dxdy)$, where $s>3/4$ and $r_1,r_2>0$ are such that $\\max\\{r_1,r_2\\}\\leq s/2$. Their proof is a little bit different from the one \\cite{BUM}; the main tool is a commutator estimate between weights and the linear group associated with \\eqref{zk}. In addition, their method also extend to the generalized nonlinearity $u^ku_x$, $k\\geq2$.\n",
      "Concerning the BO-ZK equation, local well posedness in weighted spaces was studied in \\cite{AP} from several viewpoints. First the authors proved local well-posedness in $H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2(w^2dxdy)$, $s>2$, provided $w=w(x,y)$ is a weight with bounded derivatives up to order three. In addition, if $r\\in(1,5/2)$ and $s\\geq2r$ then local well-posedness holds in $\\mathcal{Z}_{s,r}:=H^s(\\R^2)\\cap L^2((1+x^2+y^2)^rdxdy)$. Also, if $r\\in,\n",

They also proved an ill-posedness result in the sense that the data-to-solution map cannot be $C^2$-differentiable from $H^s(\\R^2)$ to $H^s(\\R^2)$, for any $s\\in\\R$. The local well-posedness was extended to $0\\leq a<1$ in \\cite{Schippa} where, by using transversality and localization of time to small frequency dependent time intervals, the author showed the local well-posedness in $H^s(\\R^2)$, $s>3/2-a$. In weighted spaces, local well-posedness was studied in \\cite{riano} only for $a=0$. In particular it was shown that local well-posedness in $\\mathcal{Z}_{s,r}$ holds for $s\\geq r$ and $r\\in$ and $s>\\frac{2}{a+1}-\\frac{3}{4}$.

The so-called GJMS operators were discovered by Graham, Jenne, Mason and Sparling~\\cite{GraJenMasSpa} by using a construction based on the Fefferman--Graham ambient metric~\\cites{FefGra1,FefGra2}. They provide a natural extension to higher orders of the Yamabe operator~\\cite{Yam} ($k=1$) and the Paneitz--Branson operator~\\cites{Bra1,Pan} ($k=2$). When $u$ is positive, \\eqref{Eq1} arises in the problem of prescribing \\nobreak Branson's $Q$-curvature of order $2k$ in a given conformal class (see Branson~\\cites{Bra2}). More precisely, the positive solutions $u$ to the equation \\eqref{Eq1} correspond to the conformal metrics $u^{4/\\(n-2k\\)}g$ with $Q$-curvature of order $2k$ equal to $\\frac{2}{n-2k}f$.\n",

This question has also been solved to a large extent in the case where $k=2$ (see Djadli, Hebey and Ledoux~\\cite{DjaHebLed}, Esposito and Robert~\\cite{EspRob}, Gursky, Hang and Lin~\\cites{GurHangLin}, Gursky and Malchiodi~\\cite{GurMal} Hang and Yang~\\cites{HangYang1,HangYang2} and Robert~\\cite{Rob1}). For $k=3$, Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} obtained the existence of at least one solution of \\eqref{Eq1} in the case of non-locally conformally flat manifolds of dimension $n\\ge 10$. The solution obtained by Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} is positive under the assumption that the Green's function of the operator $P_6$ is positive (see Mazumdar~\\cite{Maz}*{Theorem~3}). More general existence results have also been obtained in the case where $f\\not\\equiv1$ (see among others Aubin~\\cite{Aub}, Escobar and Schoen~\\cite{EscSch}, Hebey~\\cite{Heb} and Hebey and Vaugon~\\cite{HebVau} for $k=1$, Djadli, Hebey and Ledoux~\\cite{DjaHebLed}, Esposito and Robert~\\cite{EspRob} and Robert~\\cite{Rob1} for $k=2$, Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} for $k=3$ and Robert~\\cite{Rob2} for higher orders).\n",

Here again, as far as the authors know, no such results have yet been obtained for higher orders.

This approach consists in deriving an asymptotic expansion for the energy functional associated with the equation \\eqref{Eq1}, which we apply to a suitable family of test functions depending on a real parameter (see \\eqref{Eq2} for the energy functional and \\eqref{Eq6} for the family of test functions). To simplify the calculations of curvature terms, we use the conformal normal coordinates introduced by Lee and Parker~\\cite{LeePar} and later improved by Cao~\\cite{Cao} and G\\\"{u}nther~\\cite{Gun}. Our proof also crucially relies on the derivation of an expression for the highest-order terms of the GJMS operators (see \\eqref{PrEq1}), which we obtain by using Juhl's formulae~\\cite{Juhl}. Similarly as in the lower-order cases, we find that the proof essentially reduces to determine the sign of a constant $C\\(n,k\\)$ depending only on $n$ and $k$, which appears in the energy expansion (see \\eqref{PrEq1}). In particular, we recover the values found in~\\cites{ChenHou,EspRob} for $C\\(n,k\\)$ with $k\\in\\left\\{2,3\\right\\}$. We then conclude the proof by using a general minimization result in the spirit of Aubin~\\cite{Aub} (see Mazumdar~\\cite{Maz}*{Theorem~3}).

The so-called GJMS operators were discovered by Graham, Jenne, Mason and Sparling~\\cite{GraJenMasSpa} by using a construction based on the Fefferman--Graham ambient metric~\\cites{FefGra1,FefGra2}. They provide a natural extension to higher orders of the Yamabe operator~\\cite{Yam} ($k=1$) and the Paneitz--Branson operator~\\cites{Bra1,Pan} ($k=2$). When $u$ is positive, \\eqref{Eq1} arises in the problem of prescribing \\nobreak Branson's $Q$-curvature of order $2k$ in a given conformal class (see Branson~\\cites{Bra2}). More precisely, the positive solutions $u$ to the equation \\eqref{Eq1} correspond to the conformal metrics $u^{4/\\(n-2k\\)}g$ with $Q$-curvature of order $2k$ equal to $\\frac{2}{n-2k}f$.\n",

This question has also been solved to a large extent in the case where $k=2$ (see Djadli, Hebey and Ledoux~\\cite{DjaHebLed}, Esposito and Robert~\\cite{EspRob}, Gursky, Hang and Lin~\\cites{GurHangLin}, Gursky and Malchiodi~\\cite{GurMal} Hang and Yang~\\cites{HangYang1,HangYang2} and Robert~\\cite{Rob1}). For $k=3$, Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} obtained the existence of at least one solution of \\eqref{Eq1} in the case of non-locally conformally flat manifolds of dimension $n\\ge 10$. The solution obtained by Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} is positive under the assumption that the Green's function of the operator $P_6$ is positive (see Mazumdar~\\cite{Maz}*{Theorem~3}). More general existence results have also been obtained in the case where $f\\not\\equiv1$ (see among others Aubin~\\cite{Aub}, Escobar and Schoen~\\cite{EscSch}, Hebey~\\cite{Heb} and Hebey and Vaugon~\\cite{HebVau} for $k=1$, Djadli, Hebey and Ledoux~\\cite{DjaHebLed}, Esposito and Robert~\\cite{EspRob} and Robert~\\cite{Rob1} for $k=2$, Chen and Hou~\\cite{ChenHou} for $k=3$ and Robert~\\cite{Rob2} for higher orders).\n",

Here again, as far as the authors know, no such results have yet been obtained for higher orders. When $n=2k$, the problem of prescribing the $Q$-curvature involves a different equation than \\eqref{Eq1}, which contains an exponential non-linearity. Possible references in this case are Chang and Yang~\\cite{ChangYang}, Djadli and Malchiodi~\\cite{DjaMal} and Li, Li and Liu~\\cite{LiLiLiu} for $k=2$ and Baird, Fardoun and Regbaoui~\\cite{BaiFarReg} for higher orders.\n",

This approach consists in deriving an asymptotic expansion for the energy functional associated with the equation \\eqref{Eq1}, which we apply to a suitable family of test functions depending on a real parameter (see \\eqref{Eq2} for the energy functional and \\eqref{Eq6} for the family of test functions). To simplify the calculations of curvature terms, we use the conformal normal coordinates introduced by Lee and Parker~\\cite{LeePar} and later improved by Cao~\\cite{Cao} and G\\\"{u}nther~\\cite{Gun}. Our proof also crucially relies on the derivation of an expression for the highest-order terms of the GJMS operators (see \\eqref{PrEq1}), which we obtain by using Juhl's formulae~\\cite{Juhl}. Similarly as in the lower-order cases, we find that the proof essentially reduces to determine the sign of a constant $C\\(n,k\\)$ depending only on $n$ and $k$, which appears in the energy expansion (see \\eqref{PrEq1}). In particular, we recover the values found in~\\cites{ChenHou,EspRob} for $C\\(n,k\\)$ with $k\\in\\left\\{2,3\\right\\}$. We then conclude the proof by using a general minimization result in the spirit of Aubin~\\cite{Aub} (see Mazumdar~\\cite{Maz}*{Theorem~3}). We point out that at one place in the proof, namely in the very last computation to determine the sign of $C\\(n,k\\)$ (see \\eqref{PrEq11}), we have used the computation software{\\it Maple} to expand a complicated polynomial with integer coefficients.\n",

      "\\begin{abstract} We compute the $\\bA^1$-localization of several invariants of schemes namely, topological Hochschild homology ($THH$), topological cyclic homology ($TC$) and topological periodic cyclic homology ($TP$). This procedure is quite brutal and kills the completed versions of most of these invariants. The main ingredient for the vanishing statements is the vanishing of $\\bA^1$-localization of de Rham cohomology (and, eventually, crystalline cohomology) in positive characteristics.\n",
      "\\end{abstract}\n",
      "\\section{Introduction, an example and vista}\n",
      "In this short paper, we compute the $\\bA^1$-localization of several invariants relevant to recent developments in $p$-adic Hodge theory. They turn out to be mostly zero. In some sense, these are ``no-go theorems\" which state that, at least in characteristic $p$, the motivic perspective of Morel and Voevodsky \\cite{MV}, which is based on the notion of $\\bA^1$-invariance, is incompatible \\emph{in a strong way} with the motivic perspective of \\cite{BMS2}, which is based on descent properties of ``trace invariants\" (e.g. topological Hochschild and cyclic homology) of schemes.\n",
      "This is perhaps unsurprising: Ayoub in \\cite{AyoubEtale} and Cisinski-D\\'eglise in \\cite{CDetale} have proved that versions of \\'etale motives are $\\bZ$-linear while Bachmann and Hoyois have upgraded these to a spectral version (unpublished). On the other hand the aforementioned ``trace invariants\" are $p$-adic \\'etale sheaves. This paper adds another collection of results along these lines (though, \\emph{a priori} unrelated).\n",
      "The key actor among these ``trace invariants\" is arguably topological cyclic homology $TC$ of \\cite{bhm}, recently revisited by Nikolaus and Scholze \\cite{nikolaus-scholze}. This theory is not, in general, $\\bA^1$-invariant. In fact, as explained in Remark~\\ref{rem:tc}, it \\emph{must} not be in for it to be of any use for $K$-theory. We prove:\n",
      "\\begin{thm} $L_{\\bA^1}TC$ vanishes after profinite completion. In other words, $L_{\\bA^1}TC$ is purely rational.\n",
      "\\end{thm}\n",
      "This is stated more precisely in Theorem~\\ref{thm:vanish}, and says that the profinitely completed version of this invariant vanishes after $\\bA^1$-localization. One should contrast this to the situation for algebraic $K$-theory which is also not $\\bA^1$-invariant in general but whose $\\bA^1$-localization, Weibel's $KH$-theory \\cite{Weibel}, is still a vastly interesting invariant (in any characteristic).\n",
      "\\subsection{Summary} The title of this paper is an homage of the results of Geller and Weibel \\cite{geller-weibel} in characteristic zero. We give a reformulation of what they did in Theorem~\\ref{lem:hh}, which immediately adapts to the contractibility statement for $L_{\\bA^1}THH$ in Theorem~\\ref{lem:thh}. We then proceed to compute these invariants in characteristic $p$ and later over $\\bZ$.\n",
      "One would like to prove that the $\\bA^1$-localization of $TP$ is zero. The problem, and this is ultimately the technical crux of the present paper, is that the Tate construction does not commute with colimits in general.\n",
      "Therefore, the result for $THH$ does not immediately boostrap to $TP$. Instead we exploit the Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze (BMS) filtration \\cite{BMS2} and reduce the problem to vanishing statements for $\\bA^1$-localization of crystalline (Proposition~\\ref{lem:contractible-1}) and, eventually, de Rham cohomology (Lemma~\\ref{lem:contractible}). This gives us the vanishing result for $\\bA^1$-localization of $TC$ first (Theorem~\\ref{thm:tc-zero}) and, later, of TP (Corollary~\\ref{lem:tp-zero}).\n",
      "\\subsection{Vista} This paper is a ``contained experiment\" about the interaction between $\\bA^1$-invariance and invariants derived from $THH$: the results, as one can see, are negative. However we do believe that these two perspectives are complementary and can be useful as long as they are not mixed together. In other words, we should separate them.\n",
      "One concrete way in which ``separating them\" is a good idea is the following cartesian square which breaks down algebraic $K$-theory into constituent pieces (when restricted to noetherian schemes of finite dimension):\n",
      "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:morrow}\n",
      "\\begin{tikzcd}\n",
      "K \\ar{r} \\ar{d} & TC \\ar{d}\\\\ L_{\\bA^1}K \\ar{r} & L_{\\mrm{cdh}}TC.\n",
      "\\end{tikzcd}\n",
      "\\end{equation}\n",
      "Here $L_{\\mrm{cdh}}$ is the sheafification functor with respect to Suslin and Voevodsky's cdh topology \\cite{sv-chow}. The cartesian-ness of this square is deep: it requires knowing that 1) $L_{\\bA^1}K \\simeq L_{\\mrm{cdh}}K$ which was first proved by Haesemeyer in \\cite{Haesemeyer} and by Kerz-Strunk-Tamme in \\cite{KST} in general, and 2) that $K^{\\mrm{inv}}$ is a cdh sheaf, which is a result of \\cite{gh-negative} over perfect fields and assuming resolution of singularities, and \\cite{LT} in general. This last result ultimately boils down to the celebrated theorem of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy \\cite{dgm}. We see that the key idea is to find a bridge between these two perspectives --- in this case this is given by cdh-sheafification. We are currently conducting further investigations in and around the square~\\eqref{eq:morrow}.\n",
      "\\subsection{Convention} We use standard $\\infty$-categorical terminology. A little note on possible confusion: our functor $HH$ is the derived version, i.e., left Kan extended from polynomial algebras. Hence, so are the functors $HC^-, HP, HC$ and so on. Any kind of ``affine line\" appearing in this note is the flat affine line so that $\\pi_*(R) = \\pi_*(R)$.\n",

I would also like to thank Benjamin Antieau, Tom Bachmann, Lars Hesselholt, Marc Hoyois and Matthew Morrow for informing my perspective on ``motives\" over the years. Lastly I would like to thank Vitoria the cat for constant distractions.\n",

Weibel took the conceptual leap of taking the geometric realization of $K(R)$ in spectra to construct his $KH$-theory.

      "\\begin{abstract} We compute the $\\bA^1$-localization of several invariants of schemes namely, topological Hochschild homology ($THH$), topological cyclic homology ($TC$) and topological periodic cyclic homology ($TP$). This procedure is quite brutal and kills the completed versions of most of these invariants. The main ingredient for the vanishing statements is the vanishing of $\\bA^1$-localization of de Rham cohomology (and, eventually, crystalline cohomology) in positive characteristics.\n",
      "\\end{abstract}\n",
      "\\section{Introduction, an example and vista}\n",
      "In this short paper, we compute the $\\bA^1$-localization of several invariants relevant to recent developments in $p$-adic Hodge theory. They turn out to be mostly zero. In some sense, these are ``no-go theorems\" which state that, at least in characteristic $p$, the motivic perspective of Morel and Voevodsky \\cite{MV}, which is based on the notion of $\\bA^1$-invariance, is incompatible \\emph{in a strong way} with the motivic perspective of \\cite{BMS2}, which is based on descent properties of ``trace invariants\" (e.g. topological Hochschild and cyclic homology) of schemes.\n",
      "This is perhaps unsurprising: Ayoub in \\cite{AyoubEtale} and Cisinski-D\\'eglise in \\cite{CDetale} have proved that versions of \\'etale motives are $\\bZ$-linear while Bachmann and Hoyois have upgraded these to a spectral version (unpublished). On the other hand the aforementioned ``trace invariants\" are $p$-adic \\'etale sheaves. This paper adds another collection of results along these lines (though, \\emph{a priori} unrelated).\n",
      "The key actor among these ``trace invariants\" is arguably topological cyclic homology $TC$ of \\cite{bhm}, recently revisited by Nikolaus and Scholze \\cite{nikolaus-scholze}. This theory is not, in general, $\\bA^1$-invariant. In fact, as explained in Remark~\\ref{rem:tc}, it \\emph{must} not be in for it to be of any use for $K$-theory. We prove:\n",
      "\\begin{thm} $L_{\\bA^1}TC$ vanishes after profinite completion. In other words, $L_{\\bA^1}TC$ is purely rational.\n",
      "\\end{thm}\n",
      "This is stated more precisely in Theorem~\\ref{thm:vanish}, and says that the profinitely completed version of this invariant vanishes after $\\bA^1$-localization. One should contrast this to the situation for algebraic $K$-theory which is also not $\\bA^1$-invariant in general but whose $\\bA^1$-localization, Weibel's $KH$-theory \\cite{Weibel}, is still a vastly interesting invariant (in any characteristic).\n",
      "\\subsection{Summary} The title of this paper is an homage of the results of Geller and Weibel \\cite{geller-weibel} in characteristic zero. We give a reformulation of what they did in Theorem~\\ref{lem:hh}, which immediately adapts to the contractibility statement for $L_{\\bA^1}THH$ in Theorem~\\ref{lem:thh}. We then proceed to compute these invariants in characteristic $p$ and later over $\\bZ$.\n",
      "One would like to prove that the $\\bA^1$-localization of $TP$ is zero. The problem, and this is ultimately the technical crux of the present paper, is that the Tate construction does not commute with colimits in general.\n",
      "Therefore, the result for $THH$ does not immediately boostrap to $TP$. Instead we exploit the Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze (BMS) filtration \\cite{BMS2} and reduce the problem to vanishing statements for $\\bA^1$-localization of crystalline (Proposition~\\ref{lem:contractible-1}) and, eventually, de Rham cohomology (Lemma~\\ref{lem:contractible}). This gives us the vanishing result for $\\bA^1$-localization of $TC$ first (Theorem~\\ref{thm:tc-zero}) and, later, of TP (Corollary~\\ref{lem:tp-zero}).\n",
      "\\subsection{Vista} This paper is a ``contained experiment\" about the interaction between $\\bA^1$-invariance and invariants derived from $THH$: the results, as one can see, are negative. However we do believe that these two perspectives are complementary and can be useful as long as they are not mixed together. In other words, we should separate them.\n",
      "One concrete way in which ``separating them\" is a good idea is the following cartesian square which breaks down algebraic $K$-theory into constituent pieces (when restricted to noetherian schemes of finite dimension):\n",
      "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:morrow}\n",
      "\\begin{tikzcd}\n",
      "K \\ar{r} \\ar{d} & TC \\ar{d}\\\\ L_{\\bA^1}K \\ar{r} & L_{\\mrm{cdh}}TC.\n",
      "\\end{tikzcd}\n",
      "\\end{equation}\n",
      "Here $L_{\\mrm{cdh}}$ is the sheafification functor with respect to Suslin and Voevodsky's cdh topology \\cite{sv-chow}. The cartesian-ness of this square is deep: it requires knowing that 1) $L_{\\bA^1}K \\simeq L_{\\mrm{cdh}}K$ which was first proved by Haesemeyer in \\cite{Haesemeyer} and by Kerz-Strunk-Tamme in \\cite{KST} in general, and 2) that $K^{\\mrm{inv}}$ is a cdh sheaf, which is a result of \\cite{gh-negative} over perfect fields and assuming resolution of singularities, and \\cite{LT} in general. This last result ultimately boils down to the celebrated theorem of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy \\cite{dgm}. We see that the key idea is to find a bridge between these two perspectives --- in this case this is given by cdh-sheafification. We are currently conducting further investigations in and around the square~\\eqref{eq:morrow}.\n",
      "\\subsection{Convention} We use standard $\\infty$-categorical terminology. A little note on possible confusion: our functor $HH$ is the derived version, i.e., left Kan extended from polynomial algebras. Hence, so are the functors $HC^-, HP, HC$ and so on. Any kind of ``affine line\" appearing in this note is the flat affine line so that $\\pi_*(R) = \\pi_*(R)$.\n",

I would also like to thank Benjamin Antieau, Tom Bachmann, Lars Hesselholt, Marc Hoyois and Matthew Morrow for informing my perspective on ``motives\" over the years. Lastly I would like to thank Vitoria the cat for constant distractions.\n",
