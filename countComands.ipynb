      " \\noindent These statements are proved in Section \\ref{Section.Computing-forcing-extensions} as Theorems \\ref{Theorem.Computing-generic-filter}, \\ref{Theorem.Computing-atomic-diagram-of-extension}, and \\ref{Theorem.Computing-diagram-of-extension} below. In Section~\\ref{Section.Generic-multiverse} we will extend these results to look at the generic multiverse of a countable model of set theory, i.e.\\ those models obtained from the original model by taking both forcing extensions and grounds, where taking grounds is the process inverse to building forcing extensions.  In Section~\\ref{Section.Class-forcing} we also consider versions of these results for class forcing instead of set forcing.\n",
      " \n",
      " We remark here that in this context the \\emph{$\\Delta_0$-diagram of $M$} refers to the set of formulae true in $M$ that are $\\Delta_0$ in the \\Levy{} hierarchy. In this hierarchy, the standard one used within set theory, $\\Delta_0$-formulae are those whose only quantifiers are bounded by sets, that is, of the form $\\exists x \\in y$ or $\\forall x \\in y$. This differs from $\\Delta_0$ in the arithmetical hierarchy, whose formulae's quantifiers are only those bounded by the order relation on $\\omega$, that is of the form $\\exists x < y$ or $\\forall x < y$. In Section~\\ref{Section.Atomic-diagram-knows-little} we will show that very little can be computed from the atomic diagram for a model of set theory. From the diagram we are not even able to compute relations as simple as $x \\subseteq y$. We view this as evidence that for the computable structure theory of set theory the \\Levy{} $\\Delta_0$-diagram is an appropriate choice of the basic information to be used. The usual signature of set theory---just equality and the membership relation---is too spartan to say anything of use. In Section~\\ref{Section.The-Levy-Diagram} we introduce an expansion of the signature for set theory which captures the strength of the \\Levy{} $\\Delta_0$-diagram. We show that the $\\Sigma_n$-formulae in the \\Levy{} hierarchy are precisely those that are $\\Sigma_n$ in the arithmetical hierarchy with the expanded signature.\n",
      " \n",
      " We end the paper, in Sections~\\ref{sec:functoriality} and \\ref{Section.Non-functoriality}, by investigating how much\n",
      " information is required to make the process of computing $M$ from $M$ functorial.  Without significant detail\n",
      " about the dense subsets of $\\P$, it will not be so.  Recall that a \\emph{presentation} of a countable structure $M$\n",

      " \n",

      " \\section{The atomic diagram of a model of set theory knows very little}\\label{Section.Atomic-diagram-knows-little}\n",
      " \n",
      " In this section, we show that very little about a model of set theory can be computed from its atomic diagram. In particular, many basic set-theoretic relations are not decidable from the atomic diagram. As a warmup, let us first see that the atomic diagram does not suffice to identify even a single fixed element.\n",
      " \n",
      " \\begin{proposition}\\label{Proposition.Atomic-diagram-knows-little}\n",
      "  For any countable model of set theory $\\<M,\\in^M>$ and any element $b\\in M$, no algorithm will pick out the number representing $b$ uniformly given an oracle for the atomic diagram of a copy of $M$.\n",
      " \\end{proposition}\n",
      " \n",
      " For example, given the atomic diagram of a copy of $M$, one cannot reliably find the empty set, nor the ordinal $\\omega$, nor the set $\\R$ of reals.\n",
      " \n",
      " \\begin{proof}\n",
      " Fix $b\\in M$ and fix an oracle for the atomic diagram of a copy of $M$. Suppose we are faced with an algorithm purported to identify $b$. Run the algorithm until it has produced a number that it claims is representing $b$. This algorithm inspected only finitely much of the atomic diagram of $M$. The number $b$ it produced has at most finitely many elements in that portion of the atomic diagram. But $M$ has many sets that extend that pattern of membership, and so we may find an alternative copy $M'$ of $M$ whose atomic diagram agrees with the original one on the part that was used by the computation, but disagrees afterwards in such a way that the number for $b$ now represents a different set. So the algorithm will get the wrong answer on $M'$.\n",
      " \\end{proof}\n",
      " \n",
      " This idea can be extended to characterize which relations on $M$ are computably from the atomic diagram. In particular, any such relation must contain both finite and infinite sets.\n",
      " \n",
      " \\begin{theorem}\\label{Theorem.Sets-known-by-atomic-diagram}\n",
      " Let $\\<M,\\in^M>\\satisfies\\ZF$ be a countable model of set theory and let $X \\subseteq M^n$ for $1 \\le n < \\omega$. The following are equivalent.\n",
      " \\begin{enumerate}\n",
      " \\item $X$ is uniformly \n",
      " relatively intrinsically computably enumerable in the atomic diagram of $M$.\n",

      " $(1 \\Leftrightarrow 3)$ is a standard fact in computable structure theory, first established in \\cite{AKMS},\n",
      " relativized here since $M$ does not have a computable presentation.\n",
      " \n",
      " $(2 \\Rightarrow 1)$ For notational simplicity we will present the argument for the $n = 1$ case. Suppose membership of $a$ in $X \\subseteq M$ is witnessed by a finite pattern of $\\in$ in the transitive closure of $\\{a\\}$. That is, $a$ is in $X$ if and only if one of a certain list of finite graphs can be found in the pointed graph $(\\TC(\\{a\\}),a,\\in^M)$. By hypothesis\n",
      " this list is $e$-reducible to the $\\Sigma_1$-diagram of $M$, which we can enumerate,\n",
      " since we have the atomic diagram of $M$ as an oracle.  Therefore, we can list out these finite graphs,\n",
      " one by one.  Meanwhile, we enumerate $\\in^M$ and $M$, and continually check whether the most recent pair in $\\in^M$ has completed a copy of a graph from this list. If such happens, then we search through the $a \\in M$ we have already enumerated and check whether $a$ has one of these graphs appearing below its transitive closure. We output all the $a$ for which this happens. We also check whether the most recent $a \\in M$ has a copy of one of the graphs in the portion of its transitive closure so far enumerated. If that happens, we output $a$. This process will find every $a \\in M$ which has a copy of this graph below its transitive closure, so it will exactly enumerate $X$.\n",
      " \n",
      " $(1 \\Rightarrow 2)$ Again, we will we present the proof for the $n = 1$ case for notational simplicity. Assume that $X$ is uniformly relatively intrinsically computable enumerable from the atomic diagram of $M$. That is, the decision of whether $a \\in X$ must be made by a finite portion of the graph $\\in^M$ where we are only allowed to know the index of $a$ itself. We can separate this information into two pieces, that inside the transitive closure of $\\{a\\}$ and that outside. We claim that only the first information can be relevant, which then implies $(2)$. To see this, observe that every possible finite pattern of finite graphs (with $a$ as a constant) occurs outside of the transitive closure of $\\{a\\}$ in every model of set theory. So the information outside is true for every $a \\in M$ and thus cannot have any effect on the decision of whether to output $a$ in the enumeration.\n",

      " In short, the atomic diagram of a model of set theory knows little about the model.\n",

But from the perspective of computable structure theory we cannot say much using just the atomic diagram in this signature. As we see it, the lesson here is that this atomic diagram is too weak to take as the basic information for the computable structure theory of models of set theory.

Then we show that there is an effective procedure to construct (the atomic diagram of) the forcing extension from the $\\Delta_0$-diagram of the ground model.

We search for conditions $p,q$ in $\\P$ and for elements $x\\in{\\leq_\\P}$ that represent the pair $(p,q)$. This will happen when $x=\\set{y,z}$, where $y=\\set{p}$ and $z=\\set{p,q}$. So we can search for the elements $y$ and $z$ which have $y\\in^M x$ and $z\\in^M x$ and $p\\in^M y$ and $p,q\\in^M z$. When this happens, we can be confident that $p\\leq_\\P q$.

Second, a more serious kind of non-uniformity arises from the fact that, even if we are given this additional data and even if we are given the full elementary diagram of the model $M$, the particular generic filter that we end up with will depend on the order in which $M$ is represented in this presentation. The filter $G$ is determined in part by the order in which the dense sets $D_n$ appear in the presentation of $M$. If one rearranges the dense sets, then at a certain stage, one might be led to place a different, incompatible condition on the sequence, and this will give rise to a different filter.\n",

(And similarly to prove the class of $\\P$-names is $\\Pi_1$.) The trouble with this approach is that this recursive procedure is transfinite; even in the case it is internally finite, $M$ might be $\\omega$-nonstandard and thus have internally finite sets which are externally seen to be infinite. Nevertheless, the key of this idea is correct, and it can be made into a proper proof. The point is that instead of externally carrying out the recursive procedure, we instead look inside $M$ for a certificate that the recursive procedure was carried out.\n",

Such a tree has $x$ as its root, and the immediate children of the root are the first coordinates of elements of $x$. These nodes then have their own children by the same process, and this continues downward through the whole tree. This tree is necessarily well-founded (in the sense of $M$), because $M$ thinks its membership relation is well-founded. And this tree witnesses that $x$ is a $\\P$-name if the second coordinate of each node is in $\\P$ and no node has an element not represented among its children. It is clear that given a tree $T$ it is $\\Delta_0$ to check whether it satisfies this property of witnessing that $x$ is a $\\P$-name, since this requires only quantifying over nodes in the tree and over $\\P$.

Given a model $\\<M,\\in^M>$ of set theory, the \\emph{generic multiverse} of $M$ is the smallest collection of models of set theory which is closed under extension by forcing and by grounds, where $W$ is a \\emph{ground} of $M$ if $M$ is a forcing extension of $W$ via a partial order in $W$. In this section we would like to investigate the extent to which the generic multiverse can be computed from countable $M$, extending the analysis in Section \\ref{Section.Computing-forcing-extensions}.

This remains an open problem, but Usuba has recently achieved some partial results \\cite{usuba2019}.

On the other hand, \\KM{} allows for impredicative comprehension, defining classes by quantifying over the classes.

This doesn't make literal sense, of course, since in $M$ we do not have the elementary diagram of $M$ as a countable set. Nevertheless, in $M$ we do have the elementary diagram of $M_\\kappa$, which although uncountable, is a set in $M$ and therefore has its diagram in $M$. It may be that $M$ is $\\omega$-nonstandard and therefore may also have nonstandard-length formulae in its version of the diagram, which of course cannot be part of the real elementary diagram. But on the standard-length formulae, $M$ will agree with us on the elementary diagram of $M_\\kappa$.\n",
      " \n",
      " Inside $M$, consider all the ways that we might place finitely much information about the elementary diagram of $M_\\kappa$. Specifically, we enumerate finitely many elements of $M_\\kappa$ and then list off finitely many truth judgments about those elements, and use this as a partial oracle in the computational process of $\\Phi$.\n",
      " \n",
      " If outside $M$ we were to consider a full presentation of the elementary diagram of $M_\\kappa$, then the process $\\Phi$ will result in complete judgments about membership in an $M_\\kappa$-generic filter $G\\of\\P$, and furthermore these judgments will be independent of the presentation of the diagram we consider. It follows that for any particular condition $p\\in\\P$, there is a finite piece of the (full, actual) presentation that leads to a judgment by $\\Phi$ either that $p\\in G$ or that $p\\notin G$.\n",
      " \n",
      " The key observation is that this finite piece of the full actual diagram of $M_\\kappa$ will be an element of $M$ and therefore $M$ will be able to see the judgment that $\\Phi$ makes on whether $p\\in G$ or not. Furthermore, all minimal-length such pieces of the diagram of $M_\\kappa$ in $M$ that decide whether $p\\in G$ or not will agree on the outcome, since any such minimal-length piece will involve only standard-finite formulae and therefore in principle can be continued outside $M$ to a presentation of the full actual diagram of $M_\\kappa$, which always gives the same result about membership in $G$. Consequently, by searching inside $M$ for these minimal-length supporting computations about $M_\\kappa$, we conclude that $G\\in M$.\n",

      " But this is impossible, since all subsets of $\\P$ in $M$ are in $M_\\kappa$, since $M_\\kappa$ is a rank-initial segment of $M$, and so $G$ will actually be $M$-generic, while also an element of $M$, which is impossible for nontrivial forcing.\n",

So using the fact that $M$ is pointwise definable we can produce a listing $m_0, m_1, \\ldots$ of the elements of $M$, starting with the element defined by the zeroth definition, then the element defined by the first definition, and so on. This listing is canonical, in the sense that isomorphic copies of $M$ will give rise to the same listing. More formally: if $\\pi : M^* \\to M^\\dagger$ is an isomorphism then $\\pi(m_i^*) = m_i^\\dagger$ for all $i \\in \\omega$. We then use this listing to list out the dense subsets of $\\P$ and to define the generic, as in the argument for Theorem~\\ref{Theorem.Computing-generic-filter}.
